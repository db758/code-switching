I said why not you know I said I'm I'm .
travelling to learn about myself and the world in which .
in which I live not to just sit on beaches and go
yeah .
so why not?
you know let me learn a little bit .
I was a little frustrated and in the six w
you know I I didn't know Greek I didn't know Turkis
mm yes .
yeah .
and what's the point of it all anyway .
right .
you know going from one beach and ha- having you_know .
basking in the sunshine what's the point of it all
that's right that's right .
there has to be a higher purpose .
that's right that's right .
you weren't born just to soak up sun .
that's right exactly so I I &um I said here is an opportunity .
to see how a Jewish family lives why not .
and providence would have it that they were it was a June .
night there was that Friday night there was &um over a hundred .
people who were going on a tour and who
mm-hm .
and this rabbi .
Rabbi Boruch Rabin sent me to &um .
a Rabbi Simcha Wasserman xxx may he be rest in peace .
He was &uh a great rabbi whose father was one
who &um .
and he himself was a very knowledgeable rabbi .
and I was told that I I I &um .
was was .
going to I was going with three other boys to a &uh .
a rabbi's home a rabbi who you know who had live
So I .
I don't remember exactly what I thought thi
can conjure up somewhat of an image .
of like a little bit of .
what I might have thought and I I ha- I was little
that you know &um I'm going to this rabbi's
yeah .
you just &um .
eh you sit in a university what is this you know w
yeah .
yes eh .
so when I got there it was I was .
pleasantly surprised to see nothing of the sort .
mm-hm .
I was pleasantly surprised to see an older rabbi and his wife .
who bantered with each other playfully .
you know s- clearly deeply in love .
hm .
mm-hm .
um and .
I can't remember exactly what the rabbi said but
that .
had as I said I was like .
a little on the defensive a little bit afraid of you know being .
dragged into some cult I didn't know anything about .
traditional Judaism &um .
and so had he approached me like .
eh offensively I think I would have .
you know been on the defensive I would've retracted
was interested you know he was .
he just .
opened himself up he opened up his home it w
meal and the beautiful environment and he just opened up his .
mm-hm .
his life to us .
yes .
um .
eh you know he and he .
I could tell he felt like a little bit .
a- almost he felt sorry for us .
yes .
and I I thought to myself you know eh I I .
eh I could express some of the thoughts that I mig
you know you feel sorry for me rabbi I'm Phi_Beta
in one of the top universities in clinical psycholo
future ahead of me and you live in this sma
so .
but he made me feel as if he's got a jewel .
not I don't think he was trying to do it .
you know in any &um .
subversive manner he wo- he just made me feel
but it's unfortunate that he really can't becaus
so I was looking like I was trying to get a glimpse
pearl he's holding there which really that
Judaism you know he he was he was holding a very meaningful .
life you know he he &um .
I I was looking I was a person who was looking for
in my travels in life and I had met some you know &um .
some friends and some older people in my travels that that I .
considered wise people who I could learn from .
yes .
this was a person who I right away identified as
windows which you know his eyes were like windo
spoke through it just .
yeah a little bit she helped me with my computer .
uhhuh .
that's so I didn't have to cart it .
oh that was the main thing .
yeah that was the main thing because if I would of had to .
&-uh &-uh the other stuff I had to put into hu
mhm .
mhm .
I just threw everything in the garbage bag and .
and put them on this big like rent a cart it's lik
uhhuh .
uhhuh .
I had to wheel it all the way to Theta which took so long .
mhm .
and up a hill it was so exhausting .
oh boy it was .
and so if I would've had to have my &-uh .
computers on the cart it would not have been
uhhuh .
well they could've .
gone over a bump and they could've fallen off .
they .
they could've fallen off definitely it's not good to
so they .
right so may basically &-uh drove me .
oh that's great .
and .
yeah and she helped me carry them in .
so how many trips did you have to make back and forth .
oh altogether three .
uhhuh I bet you were tired .
oh I'm still tired I haven't like .
mhm .
I'm really tired my room is not even completely what .
moving moving is hard .
moving is hard .
yeah and and no one really helped me other than that I mean .
like Mira and Josh just sat there necking when I wa
oh great [=! laughing] .
they're just so lame I'm so glad I'm leaving them .
oh [=! drawn out] it's not very fun to be around
they just they're so weird mom it's like they're no
like how .
&-uh long story .
well tell me we got time .
but .
oh good point okay well it's like .
Mira doesn't really care that much about other people it's like .
she seems to be nice but it's like she .
I don't it's really hard to describe .
but .
she's kind of superficially nice but she's not re
she well it's not that she's mean in anyway she'
considerate .
mhm .
about anything like about how people feel .
and oh for example .
this is one thing &-uh .
one thing that's been really on my nerves lately I
Josh &-eh basically is like living in the room th
mhm .
care if he's in there or not .
uhhuh .
you know what I mean .
uhhuh .
but &-uh he doesn't sleep in here but he spends all
mhm .
so .
so you don't have any privacy at all xxx .
no I have none and I have to ask him to leave if I w
mhm .
and or go somewhere else to change .
uhhuh .
which is pretty ridiculous .
so this .
yeah so the thing is &-um .
basically .
&-uh what a frustrating thing so basically .
&-eh Josh like likes to play this game called mech warrior .
mhm .
which is this really stupid video game and it's on
mhm .
mhm .
and him and all the other guys on the &+ha on the
uhhuh .
so they all crowd .
oh they all come in and do it .
right and they all and they do it at the stupidest times .
they do it at two o'clock in the morning .
that is really inconsiderate .
actually that's the latest they've done it sometimes
mhm .
mhm .
but it it it's like final week and they they were
mhm .
uhhuh .
I had a final the next day .
well .
you know that's really really inconsiderate and I'll .
and it was .
I'll tell you the truth that's one of the reasons that .
I don't like coed dorms and it's not that I have any
you know guys and girls being on the same floor .
but I think that it's so much more unruly .
and &-um .
you know all of these things that you're experiencing .
I just think .
I don't think it enhances the experience I think it really .
you know makes it a more stressful .
well guess what .
tiresome experience .
I'm not going to be in coed dorm anymore am I .
I know .
it's going to be a single sex dorm .
I know .
it's in one way .
you know what .
&-uh did I mean .
did you have &+s some pleasurable experiences at the dorm .
sure I had a couple .
a couple [=! under her breath laughing] .
some random pleasurable experiences .
did you make some people some friends with people
yeah .
yeah .
a few .
like one girl I tried to get a get to join Theta her
uhhuh .
yeah you did .
but yeah she's really sweet .
uhhuh .
and .
I like her a lot .
well be sure to keep in touch with her when you move .
yeah I have her number and everything .
mhm .
so .
yeah she's .
I mean it's not like you're far you can come and visit her .
no it's five minutes walk so it's not a big proble
uhhuh .
and she can you .
you know you can have her come visit you .
honestly though I really don't think I like any of
it is .
considering I mean I made friends with joy so quickly and .
mhm .
and I've been here a whole semester and there's no
mhm .
and I've tried .
mhm .
people are just aren't willing it's really strange .
well .
you know sometimes you mix with a group and som
I guess .
but you know look at how .
but Theta is &+gr I mean I've I've made more fr
well that's my point &+o obviously you know you
you know dear .
yeah .
and you know that's what's so nice about it it is y
and &-um .
you know there's there's a a meshing there's a chemistry .
right I really like them .
mhm .
I mean .
not all of them are friendly but it's you know it's
oh of course .

beginning level, uh, spanish speakers?
No .

We offer seven different levels, ranging from

So we have something
When you .
arrive we would give you a
It's a
The first part is .
written .
and it would test you on present test, um, direct and indirect .

It goes all the way up to subjunctive, and then
But after an ins- instructor would grade that .
tsk .
then they would, the se-.
w-.
would &uh speak with you and that would be the se
They would ask you a_lot_of questions about
um, where you're from, tsk, why are you intereste
as opposed to some other language, have you visit
They're really in-.
zeroing in on how you .
use the language when you're speaking.
mm-hm.
Tsk, and that helps them to more fine tune
oh, I see.
And how many people are are in each group, &uh .
Maximum, according to our br
Although we have never had a group of ten.
um .
average is more around six, I th- and it can be lower.
uhhuh.
We've had groups of one before I
I don't think that's a group .
oh really.
xxx .
And &um .
How long is .
is the program?
It's designed to last four weeks, .
but students can come by the wee
We advise .
if they do come by the week .
that they try to come at the beginning of the sessio
You know, when .
for example if the class is going on three we
it can be .
a little bit difficult and that student will .
enter into a class that's been in session alrea
um, we frequently though do have students who don'
their schedules don't allow them to have .
you know, conformity to our, our schedule .
And th
I have been a student here severa
I'm now the assistant director.
mm-hm.
And when I first came I came the last two weeks
And
It was it was difficult the last two weeks .
Tsk, but I did it It was the only time I
And then of course the January session, when I s
at the beginning of the session .
was .
more .
tsk .
easy to .
to .
to feel the flow of the class right away because t
in front of me.
uhhuh.
And .
uh, are the accommodations there on premises, or .
No.
Tsk .
we we offer s
The the vast majority of our students take ho
as &uh .
the way to go when they're here in Oaxaca They pay .
um, a base price of eleven
And that includes a private room .
and &um .
full breakfast.
And it may or may not include
It really depends
We tell the students that .
it's not a hotel it's it's a it's a home .
mm-hm.
And the idea isn't so much for luxury, it's more for .
um .
really communicating with people and to getting to k
And the vast majority of the homes are upper middle
They're very nice homes and they're families that we've .
worked with for years .
um, if a student wishes .
other meals .
with the host family .
for an additional four dollars a day, the s
mm-hm.
And you can eat very very well in Oaxaca o
But .
the the four dollar meal would be primarily for the
interacting with the host family.
And then there's the cena@s:spa which is
That's anywhere between seven thirty, nine o'clock at night.
mm-hm.
That's an additional two dollars.
um, it can be as simple as pan+dulce@s:ita a
mm-hm.
But .
uh, and it's not it's not formal, it's not a form
Would it be possible to accommoda
Or .


We do that all the time.
yeah, we're very used to it.
oh .
xxx .
Especially here in Oaxaca well in Mexico in general

That's good.
If if students don't want to home stay and they wish .
to have &um alternative accommodations, we can help .
with apartments and hotels and that
um, they would need to send a deposit.
But &um .
a_lot_of people when they call us they don't real
mhm [?] .
Are there h
Or .

Their faces. 1
We- well hell, that's elementary school, babe . 1
I know. 1
And I don't think I've seen any of them, like . 1
tsk . 1
after that. 1
xxx in high school when st- when I was still here. 1
So, . 1
it would have been eight years. 1
Yesterday, before I saw them again, . 1
Babe? 1
Let me let me let me tell you something. 1
yeah. 1
yeah. 1
I do not keep in contact with . 1
anyone . 1
not one person . 1
that I went to elementary school with. 1
I remember when I act-. 1
uh . 1
just randomly met up with all of them . 1
Did Nate go to elementary school with you? 1

He went to &uh ju- &uh high school with me. 1
No? 1
I met him I met him sophomore year of high school. 1
oh. 1
oh. 1
A friend of mine introduced us. 1
huh. 1
So you did not keep in touch with anybody. 1
No one. 1
How about middle school? 1
Because we didn't have middle school here. 1
We don't . 1
Well junior high. 1
So. 1
I mean the one person I keep in contact w- with fro
yeah, junior high. 1
I only do that because he also swims competitively in a college. 1
And I see him like +/. 1
ah. 1
+, at swim practice . 1
who's this Babs? 1
No this is &uh . 1
No. 1
Jake Arms. 1
oh. 1
mm-hm. 1
And Babs is from high school. 1
mm-hm. 1
So it gives you an idea, babe. 1
We-. 1
Well, well, we're we were very very close. 1
We are ca- close . 1
bunch of gals. 1

I'm just making fun of you. 1
We were. 1
We like each other's company. 1
You did what to each other? 1
We like spending time with each other. 1
You did what? 1
What? 1
You did what to each other? 1
huh? 1
What? 1
huh? 1
. 1
I said we like each other's company. 1
You know I'm really upset with you. 1
Why? 1
Well . 1
because Zambo . 1
has . 1
. 1
his girlfriend is on the swim team. 1
Ryan . 1
his girlfriend . 1
is on the swim team. 1
Berko, his girlfriend came up for the weekend. 1

mm-hm. 1
Not fair. 1
oh . 1
Poor Matthew, on the other hand . 1
oh . 1
But . 1
poor . 1
poor Munger. 1
Why? 1
I I had like a heart+to+heart with Munger . 1
uh . 1

<&jus I mean &uh> [?] . 1
Tsk . 1
You know Hiam, he's really nice. 1

I like that word antithesis, gosh. 1
yeah. 1
Y- y- yeah, h- h- you have &uh . 1
oh I used it twice in one sentence, I u- that's overused. 1
um, well . 1
. 1
Pretty much xxx . 1
put it this way, uh, Munger has a feeling that it
because all the woman has to do is say yes because she . 1
uhhuh. 1
always going to have . 1
men hit on her. 1
Whereas in a man to cheat on a +/. 1
uhhuh. 1
+, &uh like his girlfriend . 1
is much more of a &uh . 1
conscious thing . 1
because he has to actually go up to a woman and hit on her. 1
. 1

mm. 1
okay . 1
so I had . 1
I that thought had never
I always thought that men would cheat on their w-. 1
girlfriends more than the womans w-. 1
cheat on their boyfriends . 1
And . 1
that has . 1
factual . 1
basis with him . 1
. 1
What? 1
oh Becky has cheated on him many a time. 1
<and that's one of the> [?] . 1
I thought only once. 1
oh no . 1

you know in e- w-.
off and on .
um one is .

exactly n people at each school .
each person at each school knows at least n@l plus
Prove that there at least three people who all
That .

It's not probability it .

But .
prove that that it must .
It involves stati- i-.

But I I mean I've gotten I've .
like .
e- there I tried I tried the simplest way
that isn't .
that isn't enough.
And then I'm working on the second
okay .
at the first school you have n@l people who know n@l plus one .
people .
out of two n@l people.
That means that they know n@l squared plus n@l

e-.
e- they're they're w-.

and I understand exactly what's happening in them.
um or I mean I understand plenty of wh

xxx .
but i- it's it's really fun but really .
but e- I wish it it were were going more quickly .
um .
But I I'm just .
I'm really really happy this person .
you know posted this list of things.
And the the really the really cool thing about it is .
yeah.
um .
like .
there are a_lot_of problems that .
like there are some problems that that because
I was able to to .
like give answers to immediately.
And then there are others .
What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in half?
yeah.
Now wh
E- I'm no- I'm not su
I haven't .
D- do you did did you did you save that list someplace?
I have the .
um U R L.
okay.
xxx .
Because because e- what I could do with the pr
give you the numbers if you +/.
y
I'm trying to .
+, wanted to look at them.
That would I mean that would be easier.
Now .
But .
xxx .
I I actually I have stuff saved in a text xxx .
Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two
xxx huh?
I said if we're cutting the Moebius strip in .
in half .
wouldn't you just get two Moebius strips?
No, that's not what happens.
W- why not?
Cut a Moebius strip in half and you'll see.
But w-.
cut cut in half which way?
Lengthwise.
okay, yeah.

that's nice .
yeah, yeah .
&+I was it a nice place .

which is kind of out more towards the suburbs .
uhhuh .
&-um and it was really &-um she has like a ton of art there .

art I mean you know all original sculptures and .
right .
really interesting stuff but she never showed up
she wasn't there .

right .
you know diplomats there but I don't know .
&-hm oh well what can you do .
yeah yeah .

Matt is good he &-uh there's like total chaos a
oh .
and &-um [=! clearing throat] his boss told he .
&-um this other woman who came in through exams like
mhm .
uhhuh .
and said I don't know what's going to happen but
oh that's nice .
yeah but they're thinking about getting rid of th
but in a way but see Matt has a permanent
so he'll have to be .
somewhere .
so in a way it might be a good thing for Matt .
yeah xxx .
if he got sent to new York or something .
yeah would they feel as though they're obligated to
yeah they don't do it like that no .
no they don't it's not eye for an eye .
no it's not like that really &-um .
yeah [=! previous word whispered] well that's that
&+ye yeah and &-um Matt &-eh just found
really .
well that's nice .
yeah so that's .
how did he hear that .
&-uh he talked well they said &-uh when
0 .
mhm .
&-um don't call us we'll call you .
and so he's like you know it's bee
right .
it's been a while and he &+w he's not going to .
0 .
call because he doesn't want to be like a nag .
oh right .
&-uh and they said don't call .
right .
&-um but he was able to call the personnel office .
&-ah .
in new York and and try to find out through there .
that's good .
and so then finally he spoke with this woman who kne
&-mm .
I'm assuming it's like three people I mean that's
right .
&-um .
right .
and you're on it and we have to interview people off
what do you mean .
well I I guess that means that the other people on
oh &-huh .
so yeah .
so that means inside track thing .
&-uh I think what it means is they just
and Matt happened to be so close th
but Matt made that interview happen since he was th
oh that's good so that was good for him .
yeah and now they don't have to fly him out there or anything .
right and &+I I'm sure it [=! moving phone caus
yeah I mean I don't know .
that's great I bet he does good in interviews .
so yeah I think he I think he did well but you know
&-eh well he made the short list [=! phone moving] .
yeah true true true good point .
xxx .
well that's nice that's good .
yeah yeah .

yeah yeah .
&+th that's good .
that's true .
&-hm [=! phone movement noise or static] .
xxx .
&-um .
well .
yeah so hopefully and he's been recommended for a promotion .
oh great .
and &-um his boss is like really pushin
really .
+, to try to push he and this other woman through .
I thought the boss was not liked .
well he's not but I mean he's trying to I think he w
uhhuh oh that's smart .
and so Matt is kind of psyched because I mean thin
really .
