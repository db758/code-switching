Right.
and I .
I already got another apartment .
for when I move out .
oh you did.
yeah.
Where?
it's on the corner of Columbia and Cole.
uhhuh.
and it's a one bedroom and .
so I had to put down like a deposit and &um .
you know and pay the rent for it so I could hold it.
mhm.
but that's okay.
oh good.
Then I won't have to, you know how .
all the people are looking for houses now.
yeah.
yeah, I'm sure they are.
well that's good.
well, so what have you been doing other than work?
um .
Not really much of anything .
um .
I usually I just come home from work and like stay home .
and .
e
I haven't done much.
uhhuh.
We went to Santa_Fe yesterday .
oh yeah.
you know me and Henry.
Well that's cool.
yeah but otherwise .
it's been a kind of boring summer.
mhm.
Like
Just like Henry and Leroy .
yeah.
yeah it's been boring for me too.
but .
at least I'm saving money I guess.
yeah when are you coming back?
The nineteenth.
oh .
When does school start?
The twenty second.
oh okay.
I d
I just knew it was around the twentieth.
yeah.
I think it's the twenty second.
mhm.
but .
yeah .
Have you talked to Lee?

I haven't talked to him since I think like Tuesday.
mm.
but he's coming back to Albequerque tomorrow.
oh he is.
yeah.
I thought he was going to Philadelphia.
No.
No h-.
he doesn't have the money.
oh okay.
and then I couldn't get off work .
oh.
so if he came then .
like I would still have to go to work.
oh okay.
so we decided that that was a waste.
Because when you went .
to Oregon he told me that he was .
he wasn't going to be back until like August becau
yeah.
yeah that was originally the plan but .
then like apparently my mom agreed +/.
oh .
+, that I would work for this place for exactly three months.
Like and I didn't know that .
mm .
so I'm required to work until the sixteenth.
oh .
so .
it's kind_of a bummer.
Well that suc-.
Are you .
you guys are staying in the house right?
ca-.
yeah.
yeah .
That's
I forgot .
yeah.
but who's going to live with you?
I don't know.
I was hoping it was going to be you.
oh .
but .
oh well .
Lee said that that you guys wanted to try to live by yourself.
No that's what he wanted .
oh okay .
because he told me because he told me you know that you guys .
that was .
because Suzy was moving out and then he said .
if I w- if I needed a place to stay I could stay there .
but you guys had wanted to like try and live .
just you two.

Well that wa- tha
and I said to him no, I want to live with Stephanie .

I di
I wouldn't have gotten like my apartment and .
oh really .
yeah .
oh .

We'll blame him.
Maybe you could get your money back now .

I mean if .
it's a month to month lease, so I'm sure .
oh really.
yeah.
How much?
but I d-.
It's two ninety five a month.
mhm.
Which is pretty good.
yeah that's good for a one bedroom.
yeah .
I might .
I don't know, I think that I want to live by myself xxx .
yeah.
Well you've wanted that for a while.
yeah.
so .
Now that I have, but I didn't, I wouldn't have done that .
if I would have known it was like definite that y
Well th- but I said to him, I don't know if Steph
oh .
I can't live with with Henry and Leroy because th
and they don't listen to me.
yeah see I thought you w- you might have like gotten
oh .
+, since they were.
Well no it's just that they like I mean I'm sure yo
but they don't.
xxx .
yeah.
No I I try and keep it all in my room.
but .
mm what is Ann going to do?
um .
I don't know.
but I know that she won't live with me because I hate John.
oh, I forgot about him.
yeah.
That's that was like the last thing she said to m
oh.
was that we could never live together because of him.
Which is fine by me.
yeah.
Because you know when he comes he comes for like three weeks.
yeah.
and I would just go insane.
yeah.
hm so I I really hate him .
I had to- I had totally fo
I guess I k- sort of like blocked him out .
I I think most people do.
but .
yeah .
so .
That's kind of that.

I haven't heard from her all summer.
really?
yeah I wrote her .
but she didn't write back.
mm.
but her birthday is Thursday so I should probably call.
I think.
I don't know.
Have you talked to Nettie?
No.
mm.
No I haven't.
w- we played pool with them like on Saturday night.
uhhuh.
with her and Anders .
and some guy named Mica.
oh that's
He's my my friend Medea's brother.
xxx .
oh that's Medea's brother?
yeah.
oh wow.
yeah.
They don't look like each other.
I've a- I've actu-.
h- I don't know if I've ever, I've only seen him from afar.

He looks like John Travolta but he has like curly blond hair.
oh really .
yeah.
He's supposed to be pretty cool.

He was real nice, yeah.
He is?
oh that's good.
Well that's nice.
Anders doesn't live with him, does he?
No um, he's like Nick's friend or something.
oh.
Or .
Mick or what's that guy's .
May's boyfriend?
m-.
I don't kno-.
Nick.
yeah Nick.
yeah .
and I guess like Nick and May were going to go b
but they asked this guy .
Mica .
mhm.
to come xxx .
I don't know .
Now do Nettie and Anders live together?
No &um .
Anders is living at
I don't know if he lived there before.
Still with that guy Mark.
Right.
yeah.
and &um .
and Nettie like started living in this place .
on .
xxx .
Girard.
uhhuh.
You know h- like going to your house.
oh okay.
and &um .
you know across the street from Jefferson .
Jefferson Middle School.
yeah.
That's going to your house, right?
yeah.
She lives right across the street from there.
oh well that's nice.
xxx and she lives with somebody named .
Christine and +/.
yeah.
+, Lily or something.
yeah they were in one of my classes with her.
mhm.

Like Christine she's kind of big.
yeah.
yeah.
and then Lily is like has blond hair.
I don't know if you know her.
I don't think I know her, but I've heard of her.
yeah then it's like .
hm .
When did she
Like in June I think.
uhhuh.
Is it nice?
It's okay, it's
Like .
oh .
There's like roaches all over the place and stuff .
oh+god.
Nettie would hate that I think.
yeah she was going like .
quite crazy.
and like I guess the girl who had it before like did

and it was all gross and stuff.
uhhuh.
but they .
we went .
on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so .
mhm.
I guess it's okay.

Well that's good.
mm.
yeah.
The only person I talk to is Mark Diener.
Ho- how many times have you talked to him?
He calls every Thursday .
Really.
yeah.
but he's just so cute, I can't say no.
He's gotten much better too.
oh really.
yeah he doesn't get on my nerves.
but he gets on my mom's nerves.
oh really.
Because when she answers the phone he like wants to
xxx .
and then she's always like I have to go I have to go .
Typical Mark.
xxx definitely .
so I I told him that my mom's like afraid of the te
but .
he'
m- .
yeah.
hm.
I- does anyone hang out with Suzy?
mm, no .

That's good .
I guess &um .
I guess little Felipe is staying at your house.
yeah, I heard that might happen.

and &um .
I bet she loves that.
oh yeah And every time I ask, because I see
uhhuh.
and &um .
He's like .
she never le
All she does is bitch .
But it's so true.
He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then .
stays home like the rest of the day .
yeah.
Why am I not surprised?

so when I was thinking of who I was going to call, b
oh it is?
yeah and I was .
so we can talk as long as we want.
and like .
Well actually it's supposed to turn off in f
I think the whole thing is screwy.
oh.
but .
you know my dad was like well why don't
and I'm like that is the last person that
For fifteen minutes .
I mean I talked to her .
like .
three weeks ago .
and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill.
Which I did.
and s
Because she spent the money on something else.
and I was just like, whatever .
She's totally nutsy.
If she like ends up trying to stay I'm going to
Well I think she's already determined to leave, isn't she?
yeah, but see, it's just like her the last minute be too lazy +/.
Right.
+, to go through with it.
yeah, I mean that's just, .
generally speaking, her personality.
yeah.
Because she was telling us she was going to move ou
mm.
and she was too lazy to do it.
so .
maybe Felipe will drive her out .
oh+god I can't stand her.
um, ho
How is Chris and how are you
Well pretty well Chris is not, is not here
She's been away with her class up in North .
oh.
up around Blandenburg for about two weeks on a,
Feldmessen is, um, surveying.
hm.
And, uh, so she's been away
She's coming back tonight.
ha.
So we're looking forward to that.
oh, I'm sorry we're goi

I bet you're getting lonely.
yeah, well Claudia's been here and we've been, w
mm.
And I'm actually waiting for Claudia to show up b

I've got a student here who's looking to, checkin
mm.
She's coming in the fall, but she was in a plac
you know Tufts has this sort of .
yeah.
sent her to Taiwa she was .
I had friends there.
She did a course in Taiwa and then she came over here, and .
um.
checked o
And so .
so it's and the end semester
Of course it ends on the twenty second of July.
mhm.
So, it's, &uh .
oh, yeah.
things are busy .
yeah, gosh.
yeah.
you still got
And then, ar- are you coming over to the States at a
No.
No.

uh .


uh .
Not enough relatives left here anymore?
Well: the relative scene
you know everybody's kind of, p- kind of passed away, almost.
yeah, I remember when I talked to you in the fall .

yeah.
that &uh .
It's just about .
oh did your sister die?
My sister pas
I don't know if you spoke to me before that or when
Or .
I guess not .
When was it?
xxx .
It may have been right after.
Well .
My father died right after we talked.
oh+god.
yeah.
yeah, we're getting old .
No, it's, I don't k
It's just, uh, people get sick, and they get sic
yeah.
And you know my sister wasn't that old and she just .
just had i- just had bad luck I guess is all you can say.
yeah.
I'm going to put you on after f
I've got to .
And there wasn't that much anything an

And then an aunt of .
an aunt of Chris's Aunt Mamie up in Maine passed away.
That, that hadn't happ-, had that happened already?
No .
No that had no
She passed away in about March or .
yeah, I think that there was some concern about he
xxx
yeah.
No, she's been, she was
She had
And then they operated on and things weren't
I actually got to see her I guess a day before she died.
oh.
I mean she didn't know, she didn't know that, th
She was .
if that was you, yeah.
yeah, she was just not, not in .
So it was a ble

Anyway, weird stuff.
yea

And how about you?
Because, e- I r-.
oh I'm han-.
e- how are your eyes?
yeah.
Well
I have to go next week to see, check out, you kno
I, .
um, not exactly


I, I'm not abs-, I'm not sure .
hm.
uh, it's been be
It was about eighty percent .

And then I .
um, I'm not exactly sure
but we- we'll f-, I'll know in a couple of days.
So are you having
Or .
y-

The right eye is, is uh, not so great.
hm.
um, and it was, it w- got back to about
you know it was, it w-, I w- was a d- detached retina.
Right.
And then they operated on it once, and they operat
And, then it w- things seemed seems to be seemed to
hm.

um.
hm.
but you know it'll never be more than about se

Eighty percent is fantastic.
Right.
Right.
um .
So we'll just
you know w- xxx .
hm.
we'll see what happens.
Frustrating.


And that thing that came up recently, am-, you kn
And my right knee, and now it'
It's just, you know, it's just a p

yeah.
um, I went to the doctor and they, they do a Punkt .

Ich@s:deu weiss@s:deu nicht@s:deu

uhhuh.
And if it it gets irritated and take some p

So it's just, I Is it, is that like wat
Is that what that is?
um, well that'
It develops because of irritation, because of a um, inflammation.

Is that from the running?
And how the inflammation d-.

I e- mean they they they don't know.

They don't .

Wow.
um, and uh, we'd been up in Berlin and we had a bi

um .
Was this last crop of Tuft- Tuftees good?
So.
Was your last crop of students from Tufts good?
How's that?
yeah well they're still here.
Right, but they're winding down, so you know them
They'r
yeah, the
They learned, they learned a
They learned an amazing am
Before I forget, I saw George Silinas a couple of days ago.

How's he doing?
And he's had .
Well he's working for an American firm over here,
um, and his wife just had their fourth child.
Wow.
A littl
yeah.
Wow.
um, about, uh, t- two weeks ago maybe.
huh.
Tops.
And I got a card from, you remember Amy Gleason?
yeah.

Well she just had a baby a couple of .
xxx .
heard that.
Well this is this is number two.

I just got a card from Ron and Doris, .
oh.
and they see Amy Gleas
And so I think they told me that.
yeah.
Have you heard from Ron and Doris?
Not in a while, no.
They are now living i
you probably knew that.


And she's teaching at U R I.

And it was a very nice letter, because it sounde
you know, I went from Chicago to U C S G to here.
Right.
And it's just such an intellectual leftd- letdown.
Right.
And she went from Penn to, &um .
To Columbia.
to Columbia to U R I.
Well Columbia's okay.
yeah.
And she said the students are just, you know, they
yeah.
Because she doesn't think the quality of her wo
Now I haven't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri .
um, you know, w- a
Because the last one I submitted, um, was in the fa
yeah.
um, in fact I'm still officially on leave.
If anything came up in the next year we could still go back.
uhhuh.
uh you know, for Sam.
Wow.
but I think it's e- very very very very .

unlikely.

but at any rate it was nice to hear from her because
yeah.
she's accepted that there's a_lot_of good things i
And, um, you know e-, their life is a_lot less compl
yeah.
Good.
And she's just not going to have the same kind of
And he .
oh.
yeah, he had been doing work for some environme
uhhuh.
And, it d
He, &um .
He was changing projects every couple of weeks
He couldn't learn the whole new area .
mm.
that fast each time.
mm.
um, and he says he went in and had some tests, and h
Which .
you know, given how he's how far he's gotten, you k
um .

I w
but anyway.
yeah, but that'
And &um .
yeah.
He &um .
Whatever's helpful.

So he found this new job as a financial consultant
Good. 1
And then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time. 1
uhhuh. 1
And they'
um, they had just moved to . 1
He's in New_York now, right? 1
a really nice house
yeah, an o-. 1
Good. 1
an older home that you know Julie is of course
um . 1
uhhuh. 1
Now she had a job with an architectural group whe
She said they had her doing things that she really w
ah. 1
and that she d- really didn't feel c
And, they mutually agreed that she should leave. 1
. 1
And so she was looking f
And, um, I'm sure s
She
She may have fo
um . 1

Amazing, yeah. 1
yeah, and so we met, um, &uh Adrian, the
uhhuh. 1
and just a really lovely little boy. 1
right yeah . 1
He's so big . 1
Well, it-, &uh Leo's, Leo's big. 1
you know, he's he's g
yeah. 1
yeah. 1
And &uh Ron and Doris sent us a picture o
He really looks like Ron. 1
oh that's life. 1
um, and he looked
In this picture, he's three and a half. 1

huh. 1
um, but Leo and Julie just seemed, &um . 1
sort of happy with the decision
And . 1
Good. 1
um, like every xxx . 1
Whe-, now is he with a publis
Which one is he with. 1
Yes which one &um . 1
Well I can xxx yeah It's one of these sort of unive
It might be a H
I'm not sure. 1
oh yeah. 1
I have two friends in publishing. 1
It may be the other one that just took the job with
I don't remember which one. 1

Anyway, he's he's enjoying it and liking it and they
yeah he seems to feel really like he's doing the rig
Great . 1
still in acade
My other friend just moved to trade publishing
mhm . 1

It feels like maybe she made a compromise but it's l
wow wow . 1
industry and academics &um . 1
Terrible . 1
yeah it's amazing and &um . 1
you know ages ago I got a card
I told you this. 1
because &uh you showed us her picture. 1
yeah yeah Crazy . 1
um and I keep thinking maybe I'd get in touch but
and then I saw in the &um Tufts thing that Ginny
yeah . 1
So, anyway, how are you doing these days?
Things are g
I think I had mentioned before that, um, that uh
um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Guss.
oh.
And that &um .
No, you hadn't mentioned that.

okay, so &um .
eh you told me that you were leaving the company th
And, &uh .
Well i-, well it seemed to make sense since I had
So &um .
oh.
So things are going
So, I had one client who said that he'd pay me a
You know, he'd, he, uh, there would be a minimum amo
mhm.
Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I
And, &um .
and, um, I've been getting substantially more work than then.
mm.
So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased.
Well that's good.
So, um, so I have a bunch of &uh work that I need t
I've been telling you that I needed to do that
But, it should, uh, it should come out this year.
oh, well that's good.
It should be done in a few months.
oh, yeah I remember .
So .
you talking a little bit about it at one point.
yeah, yeah.
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon?

I don't see the finances occurring .
uhhuh, right.
for a while.
um, actually right at the moment finances are not g
But .
ah well.
I am working on that one.
uh.
It's just .
But &um .
uh, uh, the the the main reason for that is I
ah.
uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had.

Harsh.

yeah, but, and.
Not a whole lot I can do about that now.

Indeed.
have to deal with
And .
So that's what I'm doing.
Sounds good.
But &um .
Anyway, &uh .
One of the main reasons that I've been such
I've actually been doing a_lot_of it.
oh wow.
And uh, I turned in my Master's thesis back
several, uh, articles .

Impressive xxx
from it.
yeah, actually it turns out that one thing, one little .
bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn
And, uh, .
from what I had been reading in
You see the one very annoying thing about all
yeah.
And this made writing my thesis very annoying b

yup, yup.
But, &um .
Anyway, I had been .
kind of telling him that, you know, from my
mhm.
And it f-, made .
w- the one type of solution occur, which .
was seen experimentally, but none of the other model
Yes.
They basically, the-, I I'm looking at, um, mul
And one of the .
things that they find experimentally are what
if you look at the total intensity .
uhhuh.
of the laser, you get .
an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency.

okay.
If you look, i- if you separate out the differe
mhm.
and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency.
okay.
So what's happening is that the modes are oscillati

hm.
oscillations on these oth
And .
uh .
you can .
With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency .
in a transient, but you can't find that frequency i
You can't find so that it will sustain.

Yes.
So .
yeah, that that particular frequency according to most models .
damps ou
And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it.
hm.
The only thing is, that, when you do the experiment you see it.

I see.
So, um, I found a .
simple modification of the original formula, whic
And in most cases, uh, insoluble.
But .
yeah.
it gives a driving term .
oh, okay.
So, it actually .
creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer, .
you just can't always write it down very easily.
Exactly.

So, so, so you, you-, you're pushing forwar
laser, uh, whatever it is science.
But which, um, is kind of interesting considering

I
Indeed.
Be- being an experimentalist,
But &um .


oh, impressive.
But .
So, so, so are, so are you going to get an artic
um, actually, .
I'm not sure if we're shooting for op-, I think .
Optics Letters is probably the one that we're s
I don't think it's quite that significant, wo
hm.
But, uh, we want to write a letter, and then a couple articles.


xxx impressive.
And .
I, I don't know how much you know about scientific

oh, w-, I I didn'
okay.
yeah, so that that's why it's actually a big deal is .
I mean, you know, writing a couple of article
not at all unusual in Physics and .
yeah.
uh, i- it's the fact that I would be writing a let
And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept te
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone t
people have b
You know, people see the anti phased motion, and it
I was having a_lot_of trouble getting across to him
has this frequency in the transients .
Yes.
eh
And, uh, what happened was after I had turned in my thesis .
but before I saw Neil again, he went to a conferen
this was a big issue among the people who were d
that their models couldn't show this as a driven
as a driven frequency.
oh cool.
And s- and so Neil .
then +/.
Said oh just a second I .
+, like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said,
Exactly
And I was like, well I've been telling you that Neil .
Indeed.
So .
Cool.
That's .
Cool.
that's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a
um .
Well it'll look good on your C
So so you might as well spend the time.
Yes, well, uh, th- no, it's definite
um, .
and I would have been spending more time on it if it
oh yeah but .
that I've been dealing with.
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park.
Yes.

yeah.
I mean the thing that i- this place is incredibl
oh.
It's not a question of whether or not, &uh .
you know, that, that was easy, it was just that no


yeah.
And so the problem is that now they found out
yeah.
And u
Well, i- it
They've stolen very weird things for the most part.
hm.
A- as
The first time they broke in, they .
what they stole was just bizarre, mostly worthless .
stuff.
And, &uh .
huh .
the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value
Unfortunately, because it's a nice preamplifier
which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless.
huh
So.
That's
Bizarre.
So, so so when they broke in the second time did the
Actually, no, all they stole the second time was my bike.
huh.
Which was actually where the major problem came.


yeah.
Is that I suddenly had no
And so, .
I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get an
mm.
that that cost me a_lot_of time.

Exactly.
Because, yes .
Spending a_lot_of time hunting for bikes, and .
nah well.
then getting one purchased, and then having to, .
you know, go get it and th
But, .
that's dealt
And so .
uh, that's yeah .
at le
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects
But .
yeah.

At least .
Well that would make sense .
during the summer I can actually, .

maybe have to do that right away . 1
we really do we shouldn't try to get any more mile
oh no I don't I don't really want to I just &-uh . 1
want to get out there on that first week and sta
So tell me a little bit about the da
When did you first see her?
um what happened is we went to the hospital, she was induced.
mhm.
So we get a phone call and th-, she was supposed to .
Right finally.
um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um, it's m
Right.
at &um six thirty in the morning but she called
oh no.
So she called us and told us that, but then they di
mhm.
Or seven thirty or, I guess she went in at seven
mhm.
mm mhm.
for the day.
mhm.
And um, .
we hu
We had &uh we had some difficult times with the law
He was supposed to show up .
mm .
mhm.
and we waited all day and he never bloody showed up.
oh no.
And um, he and also she was expecting him too.
mhm.
You know and so that was frustrating.
yeah.
But anyway we waited all day and &um .
But then five twenty five Mae was born.
Right.
And the birth mother's mother was with her through
She
She was so nice to us and so solid there for her da
uhhuh.
mhm.
Woman xxx .
person and &um .

She came out, you know, a couple times during the d
uhhuh.
because the first time she out I mean here
uhhuh.
sweating it out and wondering how everybody is going
uhhuh.
So I guess she was bored.
uhhuh.
You know passing the time .
So I went downstairs to get playing cards with her and .
uhhuh.
and then later on she came out and she wanted so
uhhuh
um, I guess your mouth gets dry and you just want something.

I'm sure.
So, you know, it was, it was kind of funny these very .
Reassuring in a way I would think.
y-, yeah, but these very um, .
yeah.
you know they're such sort of specific little things
yeah.
And um, .
then but they kind of
I think the baby would've born, been born sooner
So .
so I thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it.
No they can hold you back .
hm.
a little bit, you_know.
hm.
Once, depends how much stuff they give you.
How much stuff
yeah.

But anyway I think they were holding her back a lit
mhm .
uhhuh.
um, and the doctor showed up around three and Mae w
mhm.
Eight pounds eight ounces.
mhm.
And screaming.
mhm.
Really screaming and I was a
I thought oh+my+god what h
You could here her out through the doors of the hall, you know.
uhhuh.
And there were a_lot_of bab
You didn't hear them all.
uhhuh.
And I, and um, what happened h-, I guess um,
Her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born.
uhhuh.
And then she s
You can hear her .
And um, said it was a b
I mean two pushes and she was out which is really
uhhuh mhm.
Right.
Usually they look a bit bashed up
yeah.
A bit worn.
But she's got a nice shaped head and, you know s
mhm.
But did you get to see her in a few hours or .
a-.
Well what happened no right away there, there was a
delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the
mhm.
mhm.
mhm.
And what they do is they take the baby from the d
mhm.
Normally they go directly and Tina very, very swee
mhm.
mhm outside .
mhm.
and let us hold her.
mhm.
So she was just minutes old then.
Wow.
So we held her for just a couple minutes and .
uhhuh.
it was really funny because you could hear her com
uhhuh.
loudly.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
She handed her to me screaming loudly and I said t
uhhuh.
the birth mother's mother there, you know oh Rober
I handed
Instant silence.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
Instant.
She just stopped screaming immediately.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
So he held her for
And then the nurse was afraid to
Said oh she's going to scream again .
uh-.
uhhuh .
And she did .
uhhuh.
And off they went to the nursery and then you watc
That must have been very reassuring for Robert.
It was very
It was very wonderful for Robert and for me too just

yeah.
uhhuh.
uhhuh.
yeah.
I don't k
He has some, you
Body warmth or something but anyway.
yeah.
I think it's partly it but there're certain kin
I have this theory [=! laughing] that it's men who

Broad u
You mean in the chest?
like .

From the elbow down towards the wrist.
oh.
Who have like these big broad forearms.
I think babies like that.
You think it gives, it
I suppose.
xxx Do you remember Otto who moved my filing cabin

uhhuh.
uhhuh.


He's sort of solid to me.
who .
He's sort of very solid and they xxx just love it
But Robert's not big like that.
No, but he, but Robert is big below the elbows
I'll have to check out below Robert's elbows .
At any rate, &um .
So that was nice and then we watched through the nur
if you survive the first four hours of life in the
It's the most sort of appalling introduction to life. 
uhhuh.
uhhuh. 1
uhhuh. 1
uhhuh. 1
But I was kind of scared at that point because we're
uhhuh. 1
and there's Mae and she's big compared to the r
uhhuh. 1
uhhuh. 1

uhhuh [?] . 1
uhhuh . 1
they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse. 1
yeah. 1
And she was healthy I guess. 1
uhhuh 1
And she just screamed and screamed and screamed a
Did they tell you her apgar or whatever they call that? 1
How xxx . 1
They didn't te
In fact, at the hospital they weren't . 1
the, there were someth-, the individual people we h
Were nice. 1
but &um the hospital policy was rather unfriendly
yeah. 1
uhhuh. 1
uhhuh. 1
and the whole purpose of the room is to let peopl
uhhuh. 1
+, are going to be with the baby. 1
Right. 1
And they wouldn't let us in there so, . 1
mm. 1
d-, it was real
They wouldn't let us, they didn't, they they g
yeah. 1
I mean they really did
They didn't offer us that parenting class that the
mhm. 1
We would have had to come back the next day to the
hm. 1
mhm. 1
um, you know they really weren't very nice and . 1
yeah. 1
I guess they have, their rules are just very rigid. 1
mm. 1
And the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have
Right. 1
an additional bracelet. 1
mhm. 1
In other words, what happens is they put one on t
and then she has a, what you call the fourth bracele
hm. 1
mhm. 1
hm. 1
I see. 1
I see. 1
which makes perfect sense. 1
mhm. 1
Well, the only way, they couldn't get their minds ar
Right. 1
So the only way that they would have let us in th
Right. 1
which we wouldn't ask and which she wouldn't do. 1
Right. 1
Right. 1
And &um . 1
the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time . 1
and there was supposed to be I D there at the hosp
I see. 1
He hadn't done that, hm. 1

He hadn't
He's been just hopeless. 1
hm. 1
I mean I think legally he'
I think he's done all the necessary legal things but &um . 1
yeah. 1
you know in terms of the things, . 1
He's an S O B forgive me tape whoever you are but
yeah. 1

th- . 1
And &um . 1
xxx laugh . 1
I'm sorry but he was. 1
I think they said published actually . 1
oh well they can edit that word I guess
yeah. 1
It's American English. 1
. 1
um . 1
You know he, he said things to me like well you'll h

Don't worry about it, which is really an arrogant at
yeah . 1

Man . 1

He was really, he was a real arrogant S O B, so . 1
How old was he? 1
I don't know we
He never showed up. 1

W-, he ended up in the end, his par-, he sent
mhm. 1
He d
Doesn't know what he's doing but I hope he did w
mhm. 1
mm . 1
mhm. 1
But he at least was a sensitive human being. 1
mhm. 1
And um, you know so
He had some sensitivity. 1
We're going to get cut off soon. 1

And I want to, I hope you . 1
Tell me something then. 1

You can tell me something. 1

&-mm .
+, people and you know my mother had her hip +/.
&-mm .

&+c and certainly I work with the fragile +/.
mhm .
+, in special Ed you know .
&-mm .
and I've never .
&-eh been so nervous as I was that night .
well that's enough to scare the
uhhuh .
+, bring him home and have him fall .
right you know and then all I could th
+, pops something it was my fault .
yeah .
you know .
really wasn't my fault but that's how I felt .
&-hm .
you know and then somebody else was sayin
yeah you know so &+w
yes because you do very well in that ar
yeah yeah .
and &-uh then somebody else said well you need to ge
and I thought why .
I want to be with Allie .
yeah sure .
you know I have no desire I wouldn't care if I ever
&-mm &-mm .
and she said oh you need to get out and you know
that's because she needs that she could this person
&-uh .
but I don't need that I can't tell you the last time
and I'm sure he doesn't want to go out .
oh no he was terrified at the doctor'
oh yeah .
little kids were running around and the mothers wer
is he using the walker or the crutches .
&-uh he was using the walker and .
&-uh then &-uh monday the nurse &+encou the thera
+, crutches .
uhhuh .
and so today he used the crutches going to the doct
+, because it was easier .
&-mm .
the doctor's office no matter where you park +/.
+, you have a long walk .
to the door +/.
&-mm .
+, because they have like a courtyard +/.
yeah .
+, instead of having handicap +/.
+, parking .
&-mm .
and the area that you have to walk on +/.
+, half of it is &-uh like fake stonework .
oh boy yeah .
they're crazy .
this is for an orthopedic group .
&-mm .
&-mm .
you know .
they're nuts .
yeah .
and &-um and then when we went to +/.
+, pull into the parking place some dude .
&+a in you know in the handicap parking place he had
+, places where the ramp was .
&-mm .
a young kid .
and I said to Allie boy I hope he gets in that c
&-mm .
but I was parking the car when he got in and took of
&-mm .
but anyway he used the crutches going and coming I
see I never use the &+cru I'd I never &+u I would b
yeah he &+wa he was quite comfortable with the crutches .
&-mm I think they're newer .
and but he can't use them for any length of time
yeah .
and so let's see what else so .
the swelling has now pretty well gone down but he s
+, during the day .
he told me to get vitamin e@l and break it open an
&-hm .
that helps in the healing of the incision .
mhm .
and &-um .
you know and to put peroxide on the incision and that .
and then, one question we didn't ask .
pretty good
yeah
pretty good how about you

And &um I've been working up until
I hurt my back picking up Shanley

and I like taking courses and I really like it b

It's so crammed in .
mhm.
for five weeks.
yeah because we do t- and we do like two chapters w

mhm.
Because I can't really concentrate unless I'm
yeah.
Like I'm home and the T V is on in the other room I can hear it.
Right.
I need to be totally isolated and have just e
mhm.
That's the only way I can study.
yeah.
I mean I can't even study if I'm with Patrick .
because I'll sit I'll read stuff .

which is kind of weird and I'm like I wrote him a l
+, how this is not enough you know I said it's yo
yeah.
you know my feelings and +/.
+, that's just the way it has to be I
We've known each other for ten years and we've g
yeah.
and we were still here because we love each other
+, you know that shou- that should be significant somehow.
mhm.
I think it is but &um we'r
Is he working now?
No, in fact h
Did you know that?
I think I think h-.
I'm not sure if he got laid off and was laid off whe
I think he was .

I think he was .
but &um h-.
but he was going to I don't know he was going t
Was he going to go to .
He had gotten some money for school .
yeah.
so he took &um English Comp which he got a an A min
uhhuh.
and he really writes from his soul &um and
yeah I know I don't ever want to I don't ev
and he's having a hard time with it but he's bus
so he's take he wanted to prove to himself that he
Next time he'll just be doing the A and P of
mhm.
So, he told me today he just got his test back he
skipped one question and went on to the next but wh
he put it on that particular one and then when
oh .
mhm.
At the last four which were right whic

Right.
and he was really ticked off at himself.
Did, is that passing?
yeah sixty eight is passing I mean a D is passing.
yeah well see it there's different scales that people have .
mhm.
for grades .
yeah .
and sometimes &uh tha- tha- you know like a I don
It's passing but for some particular programs you
mhm.
So I was lucky I got a B in English Lit bu
Was that an interesting class?
I
I didn't like the poetry.
mhm.
and having to analyze poetry but I liked English Lit
yeah.
I enjoyed that part and that part once I got the
yeah.
and my first paper I got a C on and I'd knew the sto
It was intelligently written but I didn't like dig into it .
mhm .
and the second paper I got a B minus and then and
I didn't really understand the story so well.
yeah.
Called The Misfit .
I didn't like the author Flanner O'Connery.

I've heard of him +/.
+, but I've never read anything .
um and th- the third one we did is Hamlet
I love Shakespeare.
hm.
So I had to write a paper on Hamlet .
Shakespeare's hard to understand I think.
It is .
because you have to keep going down to the footnotes and like .
learning what the words mean and stuff .
mhm.
but we also watched the film I got th- the tape the
oh .
I watched that .
yeah.
and I really enjoy that kind of thing .
mhm .
so I wrote a good paper I made up my my little poe
and I got a B plus and I because I really I added

But daddy's a goer and .
yeah he's a goer he gets tired of just +/.
He gets tired but he likes to go to I figure he lo

So I figure we'll go down and I haven't been th
yeah they change the exhibits and stuff.
Right so I thought we'd go down there an
um atrium type deal they have there and do that .
yeah and I think the thing is he doesn't .
want to go like for a whole day necessarily but
Right.
yeah.
Right.
kind of yeah .
yeah that's kind of what I f
And then .
I had a .
letter from Mommy yesterday .
oh what did she say?
She wrote some kind of .
interesting stuff .
oh really?
about Todd, just a little bit .
yeah what .
I don't know if she told you that or not about
yeah she did tell me they had an offer because I cal
yeah .
+, cost of the plane tickets .
yeah.
and &um .
I said well what are they asking
And s
She just knew that the offer was thirty thousand dollars below .
But Todd told me they were asking two sixty.
oh really.
yeah.
hm.
And he or two fifty nine ni- I can't remember what
at two sixty .
and then agents said they should put it like .
two fifty nine nine or something so that .
yeah, yeah .
because some people and I didn-.
yeah that makes .
you know and I thought they should probably
be below two fifty would be a normal cutoff place
oh yeah.
And .
Well but the thing about that is some people look
Right, yeah.
you know &um god that is so noisy I hate it when th
What is it?
The ice maker.
oh f- .
And I mean it just sounds like an earthquake you can
yeah, yeah .
um what did they pay for the house?
What did they pay, two .
what two twenty five or something and then they put in the pool .
yeah .
And she said she said it was .
twenty below the
So apparently they're willing to go down ten.
mhm.
But to me just sell the
I mean
I mean if they had an offer they should jump on it man .
yeah.
I mean well I mean well you look what happened to x
oh yeah.
yeah.
You know I mean you can recoup a little bit .
It probably wouldn't even be a loss I don't know wha
well two thirty yeah it would be a loss .
yeah they would take a loss on it but you c- like
yeah.
+, on your taxes and &um because when .
But Susan's the one you'd think would be wanting t
oh yeah .
oh yeah .
I know well I know when &um .
You know .
Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house .
He had to sell it at a loss .
And we've taken that loss on the tax return I thi
yeah.
And I forget you can take so X number of dollars .
a year .
spread it out over yeah .
yeah you can stretch it out and .
that'll be gone but you know .
yeah .
that's kind_of a nice w- especially if he's going
yeah and she said that he .
you know .
said neither one of them had filed fo
hm .
and he said something about .
how weird .
that Julie has really butched@n out I guess she's g
oh really .
like .
short as a ma- or you know shorter than a_lot_of man
oh jeez .
and mother she's so funny when she writes some
man in the relationship and then she said I don't
oh jeez well Susan definitely wants to be a
xxx .
yeah, yeah so e- but this other gal's got her hair
no .
doubt about that .
god yeah sounds like she wants to be a man too .
mhm.
jeez .
so like mother says who knows maybe they can both be men .

That is just so bizarre.
yeah it really is.
But like I said I think the red flags were there a
yeah.
because we wanted happiness for Todd but .
oh yeah .
oh yeah that was my very first thought and I thought
yeah yeah .
But I I looked out that window and they were in the
which one was .
+, which one was Todd you know it's like hm hm .
yeah .
yeah .
well and I'll never forget that night when they we
mhm.
and how you know she thought &um you know this gir
yeah.
yeah.
yeah I remember then .
it's just the whole thing you know I mean yeah .
all the little bells went off in my head but I jus
yeah yeah .
I know there's a lady in our office who was
her last kid just graduated from high sch
mhm.
yeah.
and &um .
I'd seen her a year or so ago at a restaurant with .
a lady and .
you know and they acted guilty when you saw them
but it was kind of like sh- and it was a small rest
mhm.
huh.
yeah.
yeah.
the other people picked but it was like way out of
Right.
And there she was and so she kind of it was it wa
uhhuh.
And I thought that's kind of strange and then I thou
you sitting pretty close and stuff and .
yeah.
so anyway then my secretary t
talk in the spring and she said some- she was goi
mhm.
well she bought it with another lady .
mm.
And I said .
oh and I told her about seeing her in the
and stuff and she said well I've always kind of won
uhhuh .
I just figured that was because +/.
oh really .
+, she went through a bad divorce and and he really did .
yeah.
he .
ran around xxx he had another woman and yeah it wa
yeah.
huh.
But anyways you know it just all makes sense you kn
yeah.
yeah.
don't jump to conclusions you know just because a
and then I really thought even if they live together
mhm.
+, necessarily have to have a sexual relationship .
No they don't have to .
I mean I've thought of doing that before and I I still think if .
something happened to Ted you know later on an
mhm.
yeah.
be opposed to .
oh yeah.
get a place together or something to share expens
Sharing a place .
xxx .
Each to their own .
Yes that's right .
It's just too bad Todd had to be caught in something .
yeah a xxx .
messed up with all that so .

I guess he's still going to church every Sunday, m
yeah .
So I don't know maybe he can +/.
yeah .
+, find somebody else at church .
If he'd get another church you know I think that
oh yeah .
And .
and then .
quit going over to see her parents and stuff I th
oh it is .
It is but I think you .
but if you need that you do it until you don't need it .
yeah .
Right you have to let go gradually I think no .
yeah .
yeah yeah and when when .
he'll know when that's not right for .
anymore so .
right .
yeah it might .
so .
poor little brother but .
mhm.
He seems to be doing fine really I think so .
yeah.
yeah.
But it's just kind of interesting and then she w

God what?
hang on a second I got to get this letter
okay .
This i
It'll just take a second .
yeah alright .
thought I had everything here ready for my
oh .
juice and my banana and everything &um let's see h
oh .
I went out to see Mary last week they've
Mary was out at the nurses' station waiting for Bill
They told me she's been doing it for a couple of days.
She did know me and kept asking where I thought
Then she asked me to take her home and I told
Then she wanted me to call them and see when t
Finally I tried to explain they weren't coming an
God .
So .
my heart heavy I told her I had
I had tried to get .
her to go back to her room but she kept

I surely hope I never end up in that state.
hm.
mm.
If I do don't ever come see me and break your heart
mm.
So.
trying to see if she said anything else about .
Todd .
um .
oh yeah she said he was going up to Baltimore for a
yeah she was cat sitting yeah she told me that.
yeah she said they have an offer house thirty thousand less .
um, no, I talked to Dou
oh, how's he doi
Well, I guess Well Do-, well the thing is,
oh why
Well, the first &uh first of all, well I I I di-,
yeah
But still he oh I want some place t
It's like how long are you going to be here
uhhuh
So I really uh,
don't think that it's very appropria
Like you're on vacation, I mean, what what's the point
yeah
And it's just sort of I'm just that, that kind_of
Well you know why he wants to bring people there right
What's that
You know why he wants to bring people there right
Why

His boyfriends and stuff [=! laughing]
Yes, but I did-, e-, w-, I I'm sorry, I don't w
yeah, well
And I don't, I I'm I'm, put it this way, I don't th
huh
I don't think it's be-, well n-, n-, th-, I think Le
uh-uh
And I just don't like it, you know what I mean
uhhuh
This is not a motel, okay
oh, I know xxx

And it just kind_of annoys me
yeah
uhhuh
It's like are you going to

I'll show up whe
So Anyway, and then Anyway, w
uhhuh
You know, let's you know, go out to a movi
I wanted to see this mov-, Species movie which was pretty good
xxx last night, yeah
yeah, but the thing is is that he never calls, never
okay
And so all I get now is I get some message,
xxx
It's like I'm not going to straighten up so this c
I'm sorry

And it just, it just sort of annoys me.
yeah.
You know if you want to do s- do any of that other

I don't know sweetie, I just .
No, I just think it's bullshit, I mean that's, I'm s
I know, I just think you're getting a little worked up about th-.

I I'm sorry, I don't got time for t
That's about it, okay?
y-.
I g- I have to feed some animals now, and worry
And then this other +/.
oh are you staying over there?

It's just What's that?
Are you staying over there?
uh, I'm thi
yeah.
yeah, well then .
why not, you know
I just wish you would mention to me before you offer.
I did.
Well I was kind of saying, I was kind of hesitant.
yeah I e- w- I don't know i
You mentioned it, and then it came up to discuss
But beforehand, I'd kind of been kind of l
So.
I don't know, I just, I guess I never really though
yeah, well Well .
I mean &um , I, I d-, I just think that it's largely
I'm in a situation where I need full control of my environment.
I know ex-, I know that.

I was just .
And so I think that's why you're .
And then no but anyway he doesn't call, and I just a
I mean talk about a little bit th- rude, I'm sorry.
Well.
That's really rude,
It's just like, w-, I I just want to use you for
I mean just .
I don't think it's like that <sweetie
Well, I think e- the behavior indicates
At lea- at least, you know, Mist, Mister Mister ver
So.
No you know that [=! distorted] .
Well, no, but you know that he acts abrupt like that
Well <I'll just> [?].
I I mean .
I will, I'll act abrupt then also so it
Well .

The movie was good yesterday, though.
I a-, I'm I I might call him back Monday.
Well sweetie, what am I
You know.
oh you're not supposed to do anything, I'll take care of it.
ah I I am going to mention to him that I did think
Well, you could, yeah, I mean I think it's valid for
And xxx .
Well it wasn't a- official plan, but, it's not as

xxx .
yeah, so I just, I was a little bit, &um .
a little bit put off by it.
yeah.

And, and I was saying .
Well he could probably say that he felt put
So.
I
I was the one who suggested going out and doing something.
yeah.
The only thing he can be say put off by me is that m
I don't think that that's unreasonable.
yeah.
You know, I e- you know, it's .
Well, I know, I agree, but i-, you know, um, also
During this week or two, or whatever [
The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a so
and, putz around once in a whil
But if you want a place where, you know, it's

he's not quite like that, I mean good grief.
Yes, but still, that's kind of my, .
you know.
no he's got people that he hasn't seen for a quite a while.
But don't they, don't they live somewhere .
Well .
You know what I'm saying.
Well, n-, n
eh, I mean, I get the impression not all of them can
I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it.
No, but anyway.
Well, because, I, some of them, .
you know, it's .
oh, I understand, I think I understand what you were saying now.
yeah.
I think I figured it out that, .
yeah.
So he would like to have a place where eh they can
yeah .
And so, .
and so .
It's fine with me .
Never mind, I thought about a hilar
But anyway, never mind.
What?
I, I don't want to say.
But that's it's not, it's not, it's, uh, it's a wo
oh.

What's, what is it?
Well th- th- he or they can they can visit
ah, ha, ha.
u
Instead of coming and visiting.
yeah, well, okay .
I just .
But, I

So, e-, my, my, my thought on the whole thing is that .
you know, if if you visited him, you wouldn't want
you know, spent panting and spending every second
You know what I'm saying and that .
probably part of the reason that it would be nice t

What are you talking about?
In Japan.
I'm not going to Japan.
No, but I mean .
I'm trying to .
May-, maybe in ten years, but, no time soon
No, no, but, no, you know w
When you are visiting a town and you stay at some
So .
oh, I don't mind he does stuff on
I just uh, .
you know, I mean there's a difference between guest
I think that .

but .
There, I mean, if if if I live somewhere, you know,
yeah.
But if I'm staying somewhere, it doesn't mean I'm I
I mean just because I'm in a motel, doesn't me
But it doesn't mean that I'm obligated to stay there either.
oh well I know but e- [=! yawning].
I'm just saying there are different degrees of, you
I wouldn't want him to.
yeah.
You know I told him, I said I have no time
And I I said I .
Well maybe that's why he was trying .
And as soon as as soon as I move back here, he's out.
I I I'm I'm to- totall
I don't care if he never talks to me again.
Because, there's no way I can study with worryin

Whatever.
yeah well, I I agree wit
But, in that case, I think that while .
I mean he can stay while I'm at Erzhebat'
That's just .
Ex-, tha
That was
That .
yeah .
okay.
What is the big deal with just giving him a key and
And .
Well I have to go make a copy too .
Do you wa
Give him the keys and .
You know w
And I'm kind of thinking about saying, well here's
yeah, or just give him, just .
give him your set of keys one day when you're s
You know, go make a copy and then
And, .
I I mean I don't think it's that unreasonable for h
yeah.
yeah.
okay maybe not you, have offered long time ago th
yeah.
And j- he knows that you're not goi
So I think that you know, I d- I don't think that it

I just think he needs to know that th

That I don't want it, I mean I'd like to be able to come here, .
during the day, anytime.
And not feel like if I need a book or something .
yeah .
uhhuh.
I don't want to feel restrained because it'll frustrate me .
uhhuh.
and I won't be able to concentrate.
Well, I think that that would
Just e-, make an agreement with him at what time
yeah.

Or, you know, so like, between, .
um, eight P M and .
you know ten A M .
I'll, if I c- have to come over then I'll call first.

I mean I don't think that's unreason
Or something like that.
yeah.
Because then he can feel comfortable and you can f
yeah.
You know.
yeah.
And, and plus, you know, you're going to be at, uh
No till .
Wel
yeah when you come back I guess I'll be &uh I'll still be there.
xxx .
Still
So .
because you'll be around .
Right so and then so just .
But you'll be over here packing at that time, partially.
yeah partially sure of course.
I deposited your other rent loan check that came in.

How much was [=! distortion] it?
And I it was nineteen something.
okay.
xxx the the thing is I took out .
two hundred and fifty out
I'm going to pay the
I'm going to pay .

I'm going to pay &uh some other people.

That sounds good.
really .
over a hundred d-.
I read that in like in Chicago they said they'r

yeah so you've already started .

like I I don't cook anymore I haven't worked in the
doing with him learning how to do the orders and mee
sales people and .
um I've learned how to work the computer which
really [=! distorted] .

the middle of nex- this week he'll be there a few d
he &um .
Maybe here and there but he's really basically xxx .
What is he going to do .
He's going to be a teacher for &um .
High school computers .
oh okay .
yeah so he's only teaching three days a week so he a
the truth is he's been teaching and very .
patient and very good and he also is great that he h
I'm sure he's thrilled to get out of there .
Well I'll tell you the truth &uh .
I mean now that I worked with him one to one .
He does do everything with his heart I mean it's not
he has a different head than everybody else like
but he's very separate and he only he doesn't li
um ideas .
but &um .
I'm sure financially he was probably great for the
because he was cheap .
yeah because he's also I'll tell you I worked with
like all morning long so he doesn't eat .
he doesn't drink coffee he he do- I didn't see him d
water or anything else one day he said I better dr
but I mean you know he doesn't eat anything and then
Also he eats like a little .
What we would eat maybe half .
for a meal and that's it .
so I can understand now why he thinks that xxx bec
right that's so funny .

like aid or something it got cut off because .
uhhuh .

chewing on things and just a little bit .
there's nothing that it's like someone smoki
that .
xxx the .
addict has to be willing and and want to give it up .
but I mean it wasn't like we ever showed up at thei
right .
he wasn't .
right .
he acted normal he always acted normal when he left .
mhm .
no it wasn't like he was falling over .
right .
you know like Mike's friend Jimmy .
it was obvious .
hm .
yeah .
he couldn't handle his liquor you know and .
it was obvious .
right .
from the beginning and he you know .
he drank .
ten beers at a shot .
yeah .
well there are some alcoholics who are able to co
you know .
takes more to affect them .
so that it's obvious to others .
hm .
oh it explains a_lot_of the odd behavior .
eh you know like Jane would say that .
he he took a_lot_of sick days .
mhm .
and .
she sai- i-.
I don't know .
you know it's just like I can't understand why she
all this time .
well that's &uh that's something that's very har
oh we're such close friends though but I mean you know up until .
yeah .
two months ago we're still going over each others we
mhm .
but you know we'd go to their house and they'd open
mhm .
you know why continue if they're going to Alcohol
yeah .
why do that with close friends .
right then don't serve it sure .
or don't serve it or .
say you know I'm not we would've sort of gotten the clue .
mhm mhm .
after a while when they didn't want to drink any wi
sure .
you know he didn't have to say it .
but why continue serving it at dinner .
right .
yeah that's just a part .
to everybody .
right .
you know .
right that's a strange thing that they continue to serve it and .
you know .
yeah .
yeah .
I mean we're .
friendly with Jimmy and we don't drink around him .
right .
you know we don't have anything he doesn't have anything .
mhm .
mhm .
why tempt him you know we're not going to sit here
yeah .
sure .
right right .
why wouldn't they .
tell us to try to help them with this pro- you know .
yeah .
who knows but .
I don't know .
that they're I guess they f- probably felt it was a terrible .
shame and disgrace and maybe it was just .
but that's foolish because you certainly should .
share these things with your friends so that they ca
continue to .
use it and abuse it you know .
ha .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I hope certainly hope he'll make it .
but xxx said you know like he used to take sick days
mhm .
he he's been doing this f- forever .
yeah .
and &um .
she said oh he seems to catch everything the kids get .
mhm .
I mean whatever she didn't realize that he was .
yeah .
you know .
honey .
but .
yeah I mean I was up there last week with her .
in New Hampshire .
mhm .
and it's she said you know I've been counting up the
mm .
and he always took sick days when she was working an
mhm .
mm .
and I you know I'm thinking to myself gee he must really need .
a break .
yeah .
you know maybe he just wants the house to hi
mhm .
you know .
having to go to work and always have people arou
mhm .
to himself maybe this is just too much .
you know three kids is too much for him or somethi
right .
family stress I didn't think it was .
mhm .
because he was drinking or hung over or .
right .
whatever .
right .
yeah that .
it's not the kind of thing that pops into y- into
although I'm sure it's much more common .
than what .
we all know .
but .
it isn't the first thing that you think about when
taking sick days you think they're sick .
mm .
oh she always used to complain that he worked till
mhm .
what's going on that he can't manage his work load .
mhm .
you know if he's there from ni- how can anyone wo
mhm yeah .
and get home at ten o'clock we're like you know .
right .
obviously .
either can't manage his work load or .
mhm .
you know we just couldn't understand it .
yeah .
but .
he was probably going .
he was probably going out drinking .
to a bar .
yeah .
yeah .
so maybe she didn't know .
mhm .
you know .
right .
I mean she knew enough to know he was an alcoholic and to .
have him get help .
mhm .
and to go to Al- and she said you know lately it'
seeing one on one a .
therapist .
mhm .
but .
I don't know it's they said the next forty eight ho
oh dear that's really a shame .
oh we're just hoping he makes it through .
sure .
sure .
is he around your age .
or is he older .
yeah thirty nine .
mm .
yeah that's really rough .
yeah .
sorry to hear that .
it's not like he's Mickey Mantle on sixty three .
well .
yeah .
you know .
yeah .
well but .
it's no good at any age no matter what .
no .
you know some people catch it up with the earlier I suppose .
huh .
anyway how was your trip home last night okay .

That's all I left to the last thing. 1
oh . 1
And my suitcase to all close up. 1
The only thing that bothers me was I had to get
and I froze .
One bag full of halves .
to make Aunt Annie's peach cake .
mhm .
in the Winter .
so we'll see what happens .
I made a wonderful peach thing last week .
um you know the recipe book that Jane gave me .
yeah .
at Christmas time from .
deserts from your bread maker .
yeah .
well you make the dough and you leave
ye- kneading and raising and all that kind of stu
before it bakes .
mhm .
and you divide it into two and let it sit for a few minutes .
and then press into like a round &um .
pizza pan .
oh .
and then I put now the kids had picked berries along the road .
um .
uh raspberries blackberries and huckleberries .
So I made one with &uh that on it .
and the other one I sliced peaches real thin a
on the top and bake it and of course it's a real .
you know it's a yeast dough .
mhm .
uh it's a real good dough .
yeah and good .
and boy they were and it it tells you .
the recipe actually calls for some kind_of a &um .
on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or &uh sour cream .
something like that .
so we just used Cool Whip and it was .
it was very good it was very nice I took one I coo-.
uhhuh .
to the guy across the road who cut the grass for u
uhhuh .
and &um I- I .
and he enjoy it .
I have no idea .
um as a matter of fact I keep meaning to ask him and
we've talked on several occasions they kind of pave
oh .
um .
what do you mean kind of .
well .
have the new people have been after him about .
the potholes and the dust and everything else you know .
mhm .
and she goes down there on a regular .
basis and and raises a fuss .
mhm .
and &um they finally said well then they'd be out .
and they they &um .
oh I don't know it was &uh .
they it it just keeps get getting pushed back and ba
uh well no actually when we came home we noticed tha
uh swale off across the road .
now they still have not fixed that pipe which is m
mhm .
It's still hanging up in the air and Everhart is
we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wou
mhm .
well they never ha- they didn't do that but .
um what they did wa- well now let me see first Monday .
they turned off the water here all &uh all morning on Monday .
because the pipe had sprung a leak .
uhhuh .
so they had to fix that before they could do the
they dug .
they put a pipe &um sort of .
caddywampus@n under under the road just below .
our driveway and before the new peoples' driveway .
but the way they put it in mother .
and left it .
it blocked our pipe so that anything that would've gone .
through our pipe would've backed up immediately .
and and flooded our property .
What kind of engineers do they have working down there .
oh Everhart said he doesn't think they have any
well I went up to help &um .
the band .
people help &uh fit band uniforms .
yeah .
Now you know that in my day we got our u
this is all done by the parents .
oh .
um so I went up to help .
and I got there at eight o'clock and around eleve
uh you know as soon as the kids told him it was me
wha- that they'd made a colossal mess out of the road .
and &um so I said to &Virginia I've got to go I'v
well the- i- they dug this deep trench and .
put these huge rocks .
in the road .
Now when I back out I have to be careful .
that I don't go into the ditch across the road wh
mm .
um you know I I can't I just can't even be
at any rate they got all that done .
and then they came along and .
what they're buying now is stuff .
called well it's crushed asphalt it's recycled road basically .
yeah .
and &um .
they told us that .
it's it .
holds up better than the stone that they'd been putting on .
and it also &um .
well it it's so delightful to come down the
yeah .
but they put it all on and smoothed it they they ca
all that kind of stuff and .
um it it actually looks like road out there .
so xxx .
uh I'm pleased about that you know the w
well that's g-.
and I said to him I said to Everhart .
it's not m- they did come back and dig out .
our ditch .
mhm .
and fill our ditch with stones too great big stones .
eh .
and I said Everhart .
just don't get upset about because .
if the lot next to us ever gets built on .
they're going to have to come back and do it again .
yeah .
because there's no place .
i- i- there's .
the pipe that they put in will pour water righ
hm .
um you know and and I said I I can't help it that th
dumb way that's you know it's it's very ann

And &um the Jesuit who explained that to me said
other programs that are very very wonderful you
mhm. 1
+, but it's just that this thing is because of
mhm. 1
+, in wanting to collaborate with that project, you know . 1
mhm. 1
+, and the second one is that you live in the same
mhm. 1
Now let me say that I have seen you know that this v
and I th- you know I said to Jackie this is very i
mhm. 1
You know in fact one Jewish gal that she was just
but I said Jackie how will we say she's do
mhm. 1
You know I mean I can't say that to say I'll agree
I have also found that as in all things human
mhm. 1
uh I mean w- I've met other volunteers who are you
mhm . 1
but I sai- &uh but anyway I would like to still keep that . 1
a- and not change that with Jackie +/. 1
mhm. 1
+, and I think +/. 1
mhm. 1
+, it may might be im- it would be important that pe
oh this is great. 1
Well, I mean it is great for me I'm I'm using your p

Well I am delighted. 1

Well just tell me a little bit about your apostol
letter now pray for my apostolate too do yo
Well basically in the college . 1
yeah . 1
um but &uh I there are a couple things that I wante
yeah. 1
One is that &um Isabelle was one of four wom
okay I read that sure in your letter okay . 1
And another one was named Guadalupe otherwise known as Lupita. 1
okay. 1
And apparently she sometimes she teaches about thir
yeah . 1
And sometimes she brings the children t
oh okay . 1
So you may meet her . 1
oh okay . 1
Now . 1
Guadalupe and she's called Lupita . 1
Lupita . 1
yeah okay. 1
Now at the end of the retreat we had a little sharing session . 1
Yes . 1
And she began to speak and she became a little bit emotional . 1
yeah . 1
And she said she really wished she could talk
yeah okay . 1
And so when I said goodbye to her and everything I y
yeah okay . 1
And I told her &um I didn't I wasn't setting
if she were to talk if she felt that she wanted to
certainly to understand her but to empathize a littl
oh sure yeah yeah . 1
So I wanted to tell you that I said that &um . 1
okay now do do did you give me her number in that letter. 1
I don't think so. 1
No okay but Isabelle would know it because +/. 1
Yes. 1
+, they
yeah okay . 1
An- and she seems t- eh &uh I think maybe when
yeah . 1
+, Lupita will be up there with her students
okay . 1
+, that they do. 1
yeah okay . 1
But . 1
xxx the there are many fe@s:spa alegria@s:spa centers +/. 1
uhhuh. 1
+, so it's possible that she works in one and not th
oh. 1
But b- b- but the thing is with Isabelle I can ge
uhhuh. 1
yeah. 1
uhhuh. 1
So that's fine. 1
mhm. 1
yeah. 1
Then the other thing I wanted to mention to you is &
yeah. 1
My nephew's name is Jeff McDougal . 1
yeah. 1
He made his vows in the Jesuits a year ago. 1
You said that. 1
I I couldn't remember if I did or not. 1
Yes. 1
And so he spent &uh th- a portion of the summer in Mexico . 1
yeah . 1
And then went to El Salvador after he finished hi
okay. 1
Now, I don't know if he will c
I have a feeling he will . 1
probably spend a good portion of his life somewhere
yeah . 1
+, American or South American countries +/. 1
yeah. 1
+, but if you should meet him, I know you'll keep a
oh yes . 1
+, something. 1
yeah Jeff McDougal . 1
uhhuh. 1
that's neat. 1
uhhuh. 1
yeah. 1
And then my niece Anne &um maybe you won't meet h
yeah . 1
Right now she doesn't want to associate herself wit
something like what you're doing . 1

um so we'll see what happens on that. 1
Where is she living? 1
She right now she's in Portland. 1

+, how much God is going to be in the picture and not it +/. 1
oh . 1

yeah. 1
But I have a_lot_of hope for her. 1

that isn't stressful or and not boring.
yeah .
that's the main two combinations right?
yeah.
Not stressful and not boring .

Well it's like I have no problems with secretarial w
mm.
y- you don't get bored because you are always
and if your employer is a relatively decent human
mhm.
but you get no respect I mean oh you're
about the well it's pretty much the
um depending upon where you work and all but you
I've just been toying with this idea of going bac
But anyway .
a- and you can think about that pregnancy thing .
oh yeah that pregnancy thing yeah that do the .
Maybe that's your there's your hormones calling
yeah well no the funny thing is it's like .
ten years ago I would've said oh yeah that was what
you know but like at this point in time it's kin
uh .
eh you know in the next year or two we'd regret it .
you know we we figure it's something we'd want to d
mm .
little peer pressure .
oh no no no .
I yea- I know exactly where you're at because I t
I figure my body is a very slow &um .
yeah .
maturer you know what I mean like I didn't get my
yeah mm .
e- I mean I look like about &uh uh at least fi
+, and I'm just starting to get my period actually n
yeah yeah .
as an adult So I kind of figure well I must
could probably go a little longer than that I know
yeah.
but &um yeah I think about that too because it's
I know well I mean that's the thing kids are cute a
mm .
slept until noon we got up about ten and was like oh
fell back to sleep okay I mean we're talking total slackers .
mm .
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid
mm .
No you got to be focused on that and I wa- I mean th
I mean as far as like living situation
Right.
I'm not going to be like .
traipsing around but .
I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe.
y- yeah.
+, ten years alright ev- even if I could project t
yeah .
but I mean you got a kid you can't do fucking ten years w- +/.
I know.
+, it's like cool I think I'll go off to the Orient
I know well and I mean okay Emory wants to get h
mm.
+, you know and then then there's four or five years
mm.
He's crazy he wants it that's fine he can do it no p
although we like the place we're in no hurry to leave it .
yeah.
and that would be good .
But then you know what if he could get a position
pretty darn good because +/.
mm.
+, &um you know we're a- after after coming back
xxx it wasn't so much an adjustment to the way t
asking the question gee do we really like .
um the way things are over here with .
the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing I mea
he you know he should be there by oh .
oh well let's say eight thirty to nine .
but yeah .
well okay &um and his professor is .
obviously &uh uh a great person to work for so I'm
whatever I'm you know I'm caught up .
mm.
+, in it and and I don't like it you know .
too many days I'm I'm working and and eating at m
mm.
This is crazy you know in Spain &uh we had this .
break and you sat you talked to peop
mm.
+, you know .
and it's a fairly productive nation right you know
yeah you have to yeah.
I mean you have to like look at like both ad- I
in what oth- ever place you're in +/.
mhm .
+, and think about the disadvantages of the place
yeah .
Otherwise you go nuts right?
That's true, yeah.
yeah.
I know Laura tried to &uh because we have email and
you know remember how crowded the transportation
mm.
how expensive everything is .
and &uh I- you know I remember
And you work you know possibilities were a_lot more limited .
True.
and the language you know .
yeah.
constantly like kind of like I mean those could b
yeah .
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negat
mhm sure .
They just like worrying over them.
Well you know .
and that's why I'm I I .
it helps to have .
kind_of a glimpse into th
And that's how that's how we got to +/.
mm.
+, Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to
mm.
+, we had this idea of and I I really feel that t
so what I'm having an idea of now is .
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate it take
we have the kid probably .
we he gets a research position .
somewhere in France or in Spain &um .
and then we move over there and you know .
I take care of the kid and and .
do some you know little day labor whatever you
mm.
um and we have relatively mellow life for who kn
yeah because even like you know I mean
whatever change in the weather that happens to be right?

oh I know I know .
And and it's like .
you know what I think because I get like the same I
you know what the hell am I doing not not with my l
yeah.
you know like what like where do I get the animal
to do anything you know xxx I just lay in bed and dr
yeah .
I know.
Well .
I I know I know what you're saying I I feel there's sort of a .
a line to cross too between really planning it ou
for a while a couple months back there I was think
mm.
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it finan
is this what we really want to be worrying about ri
yeah absolutely.
and and so you know you can sort of focus too much o
And miss the present completely I mean miss like you
yeah.
yeah yeah.
you know and e- each little I mean i-it's
there's like no pleasure that's as intense as the o
the past but like when you're there in that moment .
it's I mean everything else just kind of like it's a
yeah.
You know xxx yeah .
Well .
I I know one of the best moments I can recall in
okay I get the late I get to work a little bit late
mm.
and so everyone
I'm way out there in the parking lot closer to wher
and I you know I close the door I just take a deep
and I hear the birds singing +/.
yeah.
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the b
in that nasty sterile office where the windows don'
eh &um I will be for the next eight hours or so but
okay I can come back to it you know So
yeah in that moment I mean nobody is going to like
There you are you and the birds you know .
yeah .
yeah yup hey we can find good Spanish
oh yeah .
And every once in a while when you k
just being back &um with people or or eating some pl
so it brings me back but .
I still haven't gone to that fresh French restauran
um .
I'm like dying to go there .
You mean the one right next to the apartment .
yeah yeah yeah .
Well it's not French it's just it's just gourm
oh it's not oh I thought it was Fre- ah really .
yeah yeah .
Well even better.
Save it for save it for a special occasion you k
yeah .
I will .
I should have some some visitors and my family's pla

Is the one over in Gracia that it's kind of on a c
uh .
no there's a couple places in Gracia that I've been going to .

But &uh there's one in the &um Bario_Gottig
huh.
Like down over by the Bornillo .
okay.
And it's got I've only been there I've only e

Actually you know I know where I'm going to go I h

From Oviato and she's coming she got a job

yeah .
We- well I'm glad to hear that you got a job that y
you know that when you got back there beca
yeah .
And I knew you know I knew I'd get a job right I
a- and I after I just stopped thinking about it I j
uhhuh .
um huh .
But I didn't say I I just thought that you know I'l
yeah.
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that's .
Fairly sweet I mean eh in the beginning everything
I'm not going to get stressed out abo
I'm not going to try to change anything .
Good .
I'm going to go in there I'm going to do a nice j
uhhuh.
you know i- and I'm not going to <I me

yeah .
yeah, I don't have a big draw for it right now if
yeah .
yeah me too well well .
But <like I'd love to> [?] .
That's why I want to win win the lottery first thou
Or to have enough background money to set that k
well yeah well &um good and and so you're you're pro
yeah and I probably won't .
yeah so .
&-um and now I'm &+s I'm still trying to find somebody to .
to to finishing teaching me .
rolling I I I started to learn rolls last year and then .
&-uh we ran out of weather before I could really get it .
and this year I have .
well rolling in a sea kayak .
I don't even know anybody around here that rolls in sea kayak .
oh yeah everybody I know rolls in sea kayaks [=! laughing] .
really .
well no I shouldn't say that but .
yeah I mean sea kayaking rolling in a sea kayak
&-eh &-eh .
it's a hell of a lot more convenient to be able to
oh yeah .
than it is .
to to have to get out and reenter .
than get out and then get back in in the cold water .
yeah .
yeah so that's why I want to be able to do it I mean it's just .
it's it's sort of knack you know you learn it in a
uhhuh .
but &-um it's &-uh it you know you got to get the th
yeah .
so far I haven't had anybody to teach me but I'm s
but what I've done twice this summer is go .
inflatable river kayaking .
that's something else .
in an inflatable raft .
yeah .
it's it's a one person inflatable kayak .
that's wild .
and it's just like a little mini raft that's shaped
yeah .
and there's no cockpit .
yeah .
it's all open .
yeah .
and it's self bailing .
yeah right .
so you can take it on class three waves .
well it .
well .
it's so shallow .
the floor is not the floor is not attached to the sides .
they're both inflated separately .
oh .
they're tied together .
but what happens is because the floor is inflated .
the whole thing rises up with you in it .
and as it rises back up .
the water seeks its own level so it goes out .
yeah it bails out .
yeah .
yeah .
but don't you have to be able to roll that .
so it's just like a big .
no people don't roll it .
no .
if you fall if you fall out .
you just swim up to it and you &+clam clamp her back in .
but if you're in white water and stuff you're going

twenty four thousand or something?

yeah, so what's what's the deal?
well, it's especially for +/.
private school .
well no xxx but it they, don't have masters program.
does kind of, it's new, starting out this year and it's &um .
designed to fit the States' idea of undergrad and m

school, and trying to continue like maybe next yea

so being a Finnish citizen, or being married to a
well not for that masters program it doesn't but for

so .
I bought you a little coffee cup from Tullyesa and
You'd never know it though she was a workaholic an
but &uh but anyway so what else it new you know .
well let's see our construction has started .
oh yeah how's &uh how's that problem you had with the &uh .
and &uh .
that's solved now expensive but it was solved .
it was eh yeah I know you were telling me .
so very expensive .
yeah hm .
involving a &uh tremendous amount of money but &uh
yeah .
but you were thinking of suing the person at the &uh .
well .
the cost of suing eh you know i- it's &uh muddy law
what was it .
xxx .
you know eh if it's not .
not not very happy about doing .
oh .
oh really .
ho- how you making out with your ex-law- your la-.
oh &uh my case &uh uh he's trying to &uh my lawyer i
Bill's lawyer to get together with a lawyer for In
mhm .
but so far no he says typically settlements are l
you know on the &uh you're sitting on the steps
yeah whe- when when when you going to court?
but in a .
uh well it &uh he thinks it's going to be postpon
mhm .
now he thinks it .
more than likely it won't be till sometime i
oh jesus .
so try to keep a date open we'll I'll we'll
yeah .
uh but now he's &uh he's thinking it'll probably be
I don't know he it's not delayed yet but the
does he is he still as confident as ever that the
well he's no he's very confident that we'll win against Phil .
a meaningful settlement .
but he's not .
sure that we'll win against Index Futures because
mhm .
&pe <in the next> [?] for this particular cas
but Phil's lawyer was probing around saying well wha
you know so he said .
see we don't want to settle with Phil's lawyer .
prior to settling with Index Futures .
you know what I mean .
oh it seems Index Futures is deep pocket .
yeah yeah so he doesn't want to settle with him firs
get together with Index Futures though by the way
oh is that right .
they went outside to another firm in Chicago .
and so he said to him go get together with him a
in the meantime they're bringing in two experts so
jesus .
the expert is to say see their .
you have to p- do you have to pay that or does that
eh I pay the expenses .
hm .
so &uh the expert .
Jesus how much you got in this thing already m
well not not much no not so much &uh thirty five hu
the lawyer .
mm .
eh so far in expenses maybe .
maybe &uh fifteen hundred so far .
oh that's not bad .
but the but the the big expense would be this &uh expert .
the ex- we got to fly him in from Chicago probably .
put him up overnight and pay him .
how do you how do you find an expert like that Ani .
I don't know he's going to find him he asked me if
uh because there's no commodity of experts in Philly .
most of them are in Chicago .
uh possibly New_York or Washington .
mhm .
but mostly Chicago .
eh anyway he said he'll try to find one and ac
and there's a possibility they're all in_cahoots to
yeah that's that's I was just thinking the exact same .
that they don't testify against each other .
yeah that's what xxx had .
but .
but see they're bringing in two experts to say that it's common .
business practice to give those .
they admit that they gave Phil those internal printouts .
but they said it's common business practice
but on the one hand they're arguing that Phil .
oh I'm sorry Bernice xxx Bernice told me .
Bernice says tell me that she can get that program with &uh .

it's actually very tricky we we u-.
when when I heard about the accident I realize
there was a &uh .
oh I forget what it was there was a v
and they failed to make that turn and I think xxx I
she died as a result of it you know .
yeah .
but but I remember that too and I said you know I
easily make a bad turn .
but anyway &uh .
I guess it was her boyfriend that was dr
hm .
you know .
but anyway &uh you had to be there for fifteen
so if you wanted to see it you know .
yeah if &uh oh well in fifteen minutes we got to b

yeah but in the meantime Judy got a job so they'
like six weeks worth of checks you know .
yeah tell me let me ask you a questio
I don-.
eh .
yeah but they so far they haven't specifically to
yeah .
most companies don't give you full hospitalization anymore .
yeah we do but we're going to start changing t
yeah .
most companies are making the employees pick up .
uh you know up to half of it for whatever .
and I just finished you know remember I I got a one
yeah Bernice was telling me .
stayed at Delaware .
and they were tr- real nice I enjoyed every every m
last Thursday .
great .
and then they're going to call in the .
they're going to call me in for a review .
uh .
and &uh I I it depends how the review goes I don't k
they so typically they make you redo some of
spend more time on it .
but that was ni- that was real nice I enjoyed it and .
and it was nice money for the time spent yeah .
so far I haven't received the money but I you know I think &uh .
I think &uh &um I don't have any fears about that you know .
oh that's great yeah if that that if you get a fe
yeah .
yeah oh jeez a couple .
what you do it where did you work to do it .
at home .
at home .
I own my own computer .
eh it was real nice I mean I really well mostly
before at M C I and at Western Union .
and my friends eh .
that said that's what they wanted and &uh so I
and I already did the &uh .
the project and I mean eh eh they
oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts .
hm .
which isn't exactly what he wanted but that's lik
the guy that I xxx ga- gave turned it over to he ju
and he didn't seem opposed to the way I did it .
and my friend said he's the fussiest guy I'd have t
but he seemed okay .
so now it's &um just a few other managers there t
yeah .
tell me what's happened to Gary in his interviews .
xxx .
oh &uh we're real hopeful he tomorrow we probabl
potential jo- potential teach- teaching jobs .
oh good .
One is &um .
Pleasantville New Jersey which we're not too happ
but they're the ones who &uh called him back .
for a second interview .
and they said it was narrowed down to four people .
mhm .
well so he has a one out of four chance I guess .
but &uh .
the the town is all black you know it's near Atlantic City .
and it's no-.
what town is it .
it's Pleasantville New Jersey it's all .
oh yeah suresure that's black .
it's it's it's all black and it xxx .
is that right .
it's it's tough it's a tough school .
so &uh .
It would be nice for him to get the experience you k
what we don't like about that is that's a nicer ar
he'd have to relocate either way .
but &uh Edison &uh .
the guy keeps changing his story at first he was
then he's saying well they're trying to get rid of o
he would be more of a long term sub on per diem .
hm .
so he changed the story from a first time to the second time .
anyway he's supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow .
and &uh .
if he gets the .
I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it .
because it is a regular .
fulltime job even though it might not be the great t
but it depends what they come back with at Edison
but a- also it seems to me if you can survive the Pl
you'd certainly a great &uh uh on your resume .
yeah eh yeah that he was a full that he was a fulltime teacher .
sure .
and anytime he can look for others everybody in the
really .
eh yeah it's &uh it's like a .
eh it's just about a totally black community now .
no kidding .
and anyway the more he hears about the community th
not as bad as the big city black areas but it's .
well you said he's not going to live in Pleasantville .
no no he could live .
you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in Egg
you know it could be .
do we dr- do we drive through Pleasantville
yeah well if you take the Black Horse Pike you'r
and then like they after that they had a phone relationship .
and then finally they actually met and now he's thi
mhm .
god .
he was from some place like Boston or something like .
huh .
so you never know .
it's bound to happen .
yeah .
hm .
Do you have friends Lor .
um .
sort of I have you know I have the midwives and t
mhm .
and then &um I actually went to an art thing which w
um Saturday .
remember I told you that Eve Boyd whose an O B
um .
her brother was kind of wooing me he's from L A .
did I tell you about him .
no .
well he like she's thirty s:ix he's thirty seven
and he lives in L A and he and I met him when he w
and you know .
oh I thought he was kind of cute but he was like .
totally enamored of me .
wow .
immediately which was very suspect .
even when you're even though you're older and everything .
yeah .
wow .
and &um .
but like I didn't want to get into a
you work with this person .
I had .
yeah and also &um .
I I hate to have this recorded this .
personal stuff but anyway .
well who's going to know .
this is like some university .
believe me .
oh but .
they're going to they're going to definitely eh eh t
you know what I mean [=! laughing] .
So any case I was like you know off putting but .
you know curious kind of you know but anyway .
so then he was coming back which he did come back
he thought man this is it I'm sure she's going to
around him and that and that I talked to him on
it was some like chemistry you know he was kind of
seductively and stuff and it was kind of interesting .
but then when I saw him again in real life
uh .
you know like too .
aggressive .
yeah .
you know and I was like wait a minute I don't eve
yeah .
wa- you could tell he had this whole fantasy completely in his .
I know .
mind .
that's too weird .
to have .
gotten there you know .
yeah .
but not even knowing me and everything so .
but in any case .
he and his sister .
know this local artist who's a sculptor and &um .
a- who's a white guy who's married to a Navajo wh
property &um .
on the Navajo reservation .
so we went out there and it was just beautiful I m
mhm mm: .
and farmland as well as just .
um .
a great house he built and .
so there were all these people it was just so much
he had sculptures sculp- his own sculptures of diff
a painter who showed with him and they had food and .
it was just so great to be outdoors with all these s
well that was refreshing .
It was very refreshing and then it went into the nig
yeah .
stars and the moon and we had a campfire and singing
oh that's wonderful .
It was really great it was very .
good for the soul .
yeah really good for the soul .
yeah .
and then Friday I'm going t- to the bay area .
you are .
yeah I'm going Friday to &um flying to San_Francisco .
and I'll take the Airporter into Marin because Judy
um .
and then we'll hang out with Jude on Saturday and
wonderful .
yeah and then Sunday we're going to the Jazz
Well that'll be good for you .
yeah .
and I think Tasha is going to come from Berkeley
she's back at school right .
Monday &um .
yeah she's up at Berkeley U C Berkeley .
yeah .
and &uh she seems happier .
I mean she's she hasn't really for sure got
hopeful about it and she's glad to be out of Santa
yeah .
and so I'll see her and I'll see my new little cousi
Erica's sister had a baby girl .
hm .
so you know they like nice and I'll go get some gr
Trader Joe's and get some real food .
right .
I'm looking forward to fish I haven't had fish since Maine .
they don't have fish there .
they have fish I mean they fish but I I don't want
yeah .
I mean maybe eventually I'll break down but .
So guess what I'm making borscht@s:rus so I'
good .
yeah .
speaking of which I had the Russians come to the pa
oh yeah .
we had a bash .
oh+my+god .
you have never seen so much alcohol consumed by a xxx .
re-.
r- really .
xxx .
unbelievable .
oh .
they brought all this gin .
and vodka .
really gin [=! laughing] .
they got schnockered@n they they we had a party here .
oh+my+god .
wow .
dancing around spilling stuff still sticky everywher
ah .
did you get your rug put in your new carpet?
no we're actually in the process of painting the room now .
oh .
and then I can think the twenty eighth we're schedu
oh wow .
Allen is doing the painting .
oh .
I had two sets of students have &uh be
really .
they're both married to other people all four of t
oh Jesus .
So that was kind of gave an interesting energy to the class .
was everybody sleeping with somebody else in the class .
no they were well they were sleeping with somebody in the class .
but they were all married to different people .
yeah right .
who were not in the class .
wow .
so that was kind of weird .
it was an unusual class .
god .
but the Russians are big on that anyway . 
really? 
yeah they all cheat on each other . 1
why . 1
because they get married for the wrong reasons . 1
really why would they get married there it couldn't be security . 1
they get married . 1
they get married there because it's the only way the
and then they do that so they can live together . 1
but then they're like twenty . 1
oh . 1
twenty two or something and they're not really ready . 1
mm . 1
and then they meet somebody else when they come her
mm . 1
so anyway that's what happened and it was
. 1
w- wow . 1
it was quite a party . 1
. 1
it really was but it was fun and I was exhausted afterwards . 1
mm . 1
and then we left now I really only have one mor- one
mhm . 1
and I think I'm getting three classes . 1
really . 1
it's not written in stone but it looks good and I ha
good classes . 1
ho- what did you say? 1
good classes? 1
yeah . 1
yeah . 1
and I have &uh more private students then I can han
you have to Charmin you have to take care of yourself . 1
I have to I am turning them away . 1
yeah . 1
I mean I actually am including the woman who I was
did she ever show up? 1
she did show up and she told me this
it was just like the Alice Walker story except th
. 1
and this one became Alice Walker . 1
mm . 1
and this woman . 1
stops studying and forgot how to read . 1
mhm . 1
so anyway I went out and bought all these books
. 1
she's always calling and cancelling or
I have a bunch of students here asking for this time . 1
so I'm not going to be able to give two days a week
if he had asked for three originally of course she never comes . 1
mhm . 1
I said so if she wants to come she can come on S
I said she doesn't come any times a week . 1
sh-. 1
so it's ridiculous . 1
right . 1
so he said I don't know I'll have to have her call
yeah . 1
because I think she has so much real resistance t
yeah . 1
yeah . 1
so if then I can fit a couple other people in if that happens . 1
but I have to restrict myself during the week if I'm
mm . 1
I know it Charmin . 1
it's absurd . 1
I have no life so Allen is like ha- d
mhm . 1
so hopefully oh we'll see . 1
but I'm I'm doing well . 1
oh wow . 1
at least . 1
wow so does Allen feel weird that that Fall is beg
no because he now has so many students to tutor he
really . 1
yeah . 1
oh . 1
he put up ads and people respond . 1
oh . 1
so he's actually happy because he's tutoring kids . 1
a- whatever he wants and &uh not what he doesn't want . 1
mhm . 1
mhm . 1
and he's got the garden on Fridays . 1
mm . 1
and he's like doing all these you know around the house things . 1
mhm . 1
so he's happy today was the first day of school and
&uh . 1
isn't that exciting . 1
ye:s [=! laughing] . 1
I'm so happy for him . 1
yeah . 1
It's really better . 1
but I if I don't you know slow it down a little I'l
I know . 1
so I'm slowing it down a little . 1
I'm consciously limiting myself . 1
yeah . 1
or trying to make groups of people . 1
does Mark have classes this year do you know? 1
yeah we we're all supposedly going to get classes . 1
oh . 1
I feel real weird about him I keep having dreams
really . 1
I think that some deep level I don't trust her . 1
of course not she's a Pole . 1
speaking of which &um Chicago is also very very Polish . 1
yes I knew that . 1
I never knew that . 1
oh you didn't . 1
no . 1
oh yeah I knew that . 1
and not very Russian . 1
mhm . 1
d- &uh I don't know if there is a big E S L thi
mm . 1
and there was really not much . 1
mm . 1
so while I was there I decided to spend a
. 1
did you what did you do? 1
I bought three books by Bogakoff . 1
uhhuh . 1
instead of TOEFL prep book . 1
uhhuh . 1
so now I bought everything I could fi
wow . 1
wow . 1
I'm reading one now called Heart Of A Dog . 1
oh I think I know that one . 1
because I have this friend you know who's my former

that you'll try .
and that I should make su-.
no that .
three days .
How many days and all .
yeah I think I get there around noon .
Lau-.
and that's one of the three days .
if you get there noon that means you won't get like
two three in the afternoon +/.
+, so you have the evening you have one evening .
okay well I can do another day the problem is that
yeah tha-.
oh oh well hm .
like I don't I don't have that much time I had to le
Do you have to make the do you have to make the dec
I've got until like the twentieth I think .
no no no I mean once you've done it and you're comi
I thought you know how those things are I could prob
<they are> [?] .
that's the trouble well well the packed flights I su
right .
granted .
that's what I mean th- th- th- you could move that par-.
except there's the flights from there to Hong_Kong
and we're talking like January first .
Well that's true .
yeah .
and so that's when everybody goes back .
You're right .
No no not that you're missing the point .
the point my point is a United flight from Singapore
yeah .
is one that goes Singapore Hong_Kong U S .
It'll be crowded yeah .
um U S yeah .
So those flights will still be tight .
You wouldn't believe how much trouble I had getting
I believe it yeah .
I figured &uh .
We're having trouble .
mhm .
mhm .
well that's that's uh Japan Hawaii is is very crowded .
mhm .
yeah .
Japanese are just .
oof .
uh really apparently travel xxx .
no apparently it doesn't matter .
yeah .
you should have heard it was amazing I called every
right .
and I called &uh it was with much hesitanc
because I hate them so much .
yeah .
I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured o
She had me st- go from like Philadelphia to
to Hawaii to Guam .
to Hong_Kong to Tokyo to Singapo- I mean she had me .
everywhere .
I think they're the only ones who go to .
and she'd for three thousand dollars .
I was like are you joking .
Uy .
oh I have take fr-.
in a couple weeks I have to Guam and they're the on
the Continental?
Continental yeah .
That's funny .
good luck can you at least go business class .
I don't know if I can or not .
yeah oh by the way you were right with Singapor
Right xxx miles .
to frequent flyers .
Right yeah .
They go &um Singapore Air takes you around .
through Europe .
they do a route that way yeah .
yeah that's how they like to go .
if if I you know could have gone specially through Hong_Kong .
right .
but that was more a little bit more expensive .
and they they al- they also have connections with Delta .
yeah .
they only give miles on Delta but you can buy Delta
right well that's they were actually they were goin
I almost thought it would be worth it to do that
uh fewer connections but I th- instead of connecting in &um .
eh well I mean it is a_lot further to go through Jap
but the problem with Singapore Air is I have to t
Uy .
which I now remember going from the domestic
right .
well T W A is not too bad .
you have to walk a little bit but .
yeah no I mean it's just not .
shi- it just yeah .
it's not saving me much if I have to go through New_York .
but Tokyo is a bad place to layover .
Tokyo is a ba- and I have like an eight hour or fi
I know yeah usually yeah .
It's crazy .
No but it's annoying that I have to go through Tok
right .
I'm surprised you didn't go Hong Ko- the the- [=! st
San_Francisco .
yeah was it is or Hong_Kong San_Francisco .
yes .
but it's full .
United does have that .
oh it's full I see .

mm .
which maybe I'll look it maybe I'll find out how m
Can you get on
Can you get on a waiting list .
I'll find out when I call back to confirm .
Yes, it's worth waiting l- eh with Hong_Kong Sa
where's Tokyo take you to Tokyo to where .
San_Francisco I don't know if it's the same old same old .
oh oh no yes same thing yeah yeah .
yeah probably but I have a feeling it's like a price thing .
Might not be .
I don't know .

most crucial time &-um that's when supposedly the ce
&-mm .
and they do ultrasounds on her every week .
who's she going to ?
she sees doctor Ryder &+h &-uh he's been her doc
yeah .

Trevor get down, babe [=! background voices] .

come on chubby, you can come out and play toys w
you just want to do that [=! baby crying] .
&-um but so yeah then she's going to be back and t
back to new York after that so I guess Brooke is com
&-mm boy, that would be a long haul .
yeah it's like I can't remember how many forty som
yeah .
something like that it sounded awful .
&-hm .
what was I going to oh tell don I didn't mean to be
oh .
it doesn't &-uh they won't allow it or whatever so .
oh no he .
in the first minute you have to get the other person

&-uh oh .
he don't want to listen he's .
so hyper I don't know we'll see he's only gone th
said something but which was I guess monday she ha
so we'll see .
well you know the kids in Casey's kindergarten class are .
I mean last year and it's the same kids that got i
yeah .
I mean I wouldn't worry about it because I think
so does he have Lindsay in his class xxx .
yes, he does he was not very calm about it .
he's like oh great &+lind in my &+cla wel
uhhuh .
and &-uh had seen sandy and Casey came home and goe
&-um must have been last week lee was coming to pick up .
Lindsay and I said you know I've meant to say somet
he's like oh yeah we play volleyball together and s
so yeah they're in class together and Casey was
which is pretty good for them .
&-um because they moved up the round the tea
&-um Lindsay was going to be sitting next to Randy w
mhm .
and &-uh Lindsay was complaining about it and it w
stupid and you know and make Casey real mad and h
mhm .
you guys get down
the neighbor lady doesn't like them by her .
yard she'll come out and yell at them with her broom .

no .
yeah I was in the hospital .
why ?
oh I was bleeding I &-uh .
oh .
had blood in my stools and so I got real sick and .
I guess I have colitis .
&-mm .
and &-uh stuff so .
babysitting probably isn't the best thin
stress caused it's a genetic disorder or whatever but &-um .
it doesn't help it either it causes it to flare up so .
yeah will they tell you to watch your diet are you on any .
no he said to do nothing &+bu I mean they basically said if .
if I know something bothers me then avoid it but
preventative medicine for it &-uh and the medici
are not something they want you to stay on perm
&-hm .
I guess cancer mainly I don't know he didn't go in
anyway so when I get sick and I guess start [
and they'll put me on medicine which they
oh because both my mom and my sister have colitis .
mhm .
and they told my sister off and on that they had com
that could really ease her because she has you kn
then they said there were quite a few things out
mhm .

I was thinking I was going to go to the health foo
there's so many different kinds of colitis he &+sa h
a broad range of things and there's irritable bowel disease .
right .
and there's inflammatory .
right .
which inflammatory is what I have and that's a g
type and not quite as serious because there's two
is a ulcerative colitis and one is &-um crones colitis .
right .
and he told me within five years I would proba
well that's what .
which is better than the other because the other tu
they they told don that he has crones well, doct
you know that sounds like you've got crones but
thank you babe &-um he won't ever go to have another test done .
well well, I had to have surgery they put that scope .
you know because they're not the most yeah .
I've been there, but they put you out so .
I guess oh well he doesn't even want to do any of th
&-um either an enema or the you know where you have
yeah .
mhm [=! kids playing] .
and I made a doctor's appointment for him well be

yeah . 1
anyway, so I was not telling you about pappy so I to
terrible . 1
I know I felt so bad for him and he he was getting
I got all upse
because I messed i
I made a big mistake. 1
because Shuki had spoken to Taty . 1
xxx . 1
and Taty had said, he's fed up with mommy this and
so Shuki came back and he told xxx ah, . 1
Taty spoke to him and he was like all feeling bad for Taty . 1
and he sort of, you know, you see that's why . 1
and then later . 1
because mommy . 1
did not want to . 1
send . 1
tell me what Taty told Shuki you have to hear

he's
I couldn't imagine what Taty told him already . 1
yeah . 1
right? 1
so I called Shuki up, . 1
yeah . 1
what did
he'
you just told me that you know, you had enough, an
and the first thing that came out of my eyes, ah,
why was &ta-, Taty treating you so badly all the t
you're like, when you're in it you don't see it,
do you know what I'm saying? 1
but you think he was just looking for an excuse? 1

he needed a reason . 1
when did xxx . 1
ow, I hurt myself . 1
when, when did he tell this to Shuki? 1
before he Shuki went to xxx . 1
ah . 1
so I was very stupid, because I should not have o
why am I looking to make more problems? 1
xxx . 1
but you know when something just slips out of beca
explanation, Leeza built it up to who knows what . 1
I am not telling you, you call Shuki that ah, so a
which
it was a big mistake. 1
but then, so now Shuki's a . 1
but why is Leeza making
. 1

because Leeza likes to see mummy wrong. 1
Dear pappy had enough wh-, I told Leeza what kin
right . 1
what's so exciting about pappy had enough, he's f
many times. 1
but then he can't . 1
yeah, well then he can't xxx but you know, he's like a homemade . 1
right . 1
cartologist [: cartographer] over here . 1
and you should just know that without telling Sh-, I
I don't know, I I I I believe very much what Rabbi G
no I'll tell you why . 1
because mommy told me, mommy told me what goes on in the house. 1
yeah . 1
what . 1
Because of Taty she says he, she mommy was trying
what? 1
he's very jealous and he can't stand xxx and xxx wh
oh . 1
she says you have to hear the comments that he says
it's our Rosh Hashanah, and this is pure pure loshe
okay, I want to tell you something, I want to tell y
he's against Shuki and xxx because he's , a disagr
he has a very hard xxx . 1
not because he's jealous . 1
I think so . 1
not because he's jealous . 1
I want to tell you one thing that I told Shuki, I
he was always the forgiving type which is why I ca
let me tell you something, it takes a very selfish
to be jealous of
there is no such thing. 1
yeah, but you know what +/. 1
Well, but if there is . 1
+, Sara what why not you know what went on in my mind? 1
I don't even know if I should even open my mouth and say this . 1
but do you know when Taty stopped talking to me? 1
it happened when Shuki got engaged, but do you
I also bought a house and moved into it just then . 1

stepped into my house since, and I've got to convince now . 1

That's good I heard some lady died while he was
oh I'm sure s- there's a_lot_of people I'm sure th
yeah .
yeah it actually was &um the &uh the &uh the coverag
the sense was good because &um .
oh .
a_lot oh yeah and he has to yield his presence .
uhhuh.
You know how he has his presence and people are a
yeah yeah .
feel that that whole phenomena's still xxx .
yeah .
um .
Because the Italians made it sound that they
And the reporters weren't ready and they weren't t
c- &uh good coverage in the United States .
Well I know before h- well that maybe .
tr- true &uh .

yeah .
I don't watch T V so I don't know what's on T V but &um .
the &um .
the news-.
uhhuh .
Well in the see before they had .
various theologians who are critics of them .
yeah .
who were &um you know saying that you know he's just .
he's not in touch and all this stuff .
yeah .
there there was that aspect but once he was here th
it it doesn't make any difference what the press says because .
uhhuh .
because once yeah he has those huge crowds .
yeah yeah .
And that and you know there's still like .
Mi- mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds .
yeah yeah .
And his &um ability to have like instant conversions I mean I .
I've known tons of people and they're just there
yeah that's good .
So I mean it doe- I mean granted he the process does
Right .
but there's something about him where he's .
he doesn't need the press .
yeah yeah I mean it .
yeah .
I mean because he's able to get the &um .
you know so that .
yeah I mean in in j- oh I guess it's .
you just become so it's so much part of What you expect .
there will be this qu- like they'll bring up all
st- st- statistics how people .
while even while they like the pope they disagree wi
uhhuh .
d- I mean they'll they always do so you kind of .
oh yeah that's normal .
just become accustomed to it .
Right .
But &uh I know but just he it's amazing how &um .
you know i- it's i-.

And now?
Well I mean you know he's down in back in Texas he's
oh that's been it .
Well he was here from May thro- until the end of August .
mhm.
And then &um .
He went back down to teach you know and this is sup
and then he was going to be up here the next year and then .
I was either going to go down there or we would hope
mhm .
because I'm going to apply for jobs thi
you know for real tenure track teaching job .
huh .
fantastic .
yeah it'll be wonderful if I get I if
yeah .
But &um .
So what really brought all this on this tim
mhm .
We went to visit the only vacation we took this s
xxx .
And I wrote you that letter that we were going there .
No .
Did you get you didn't get my letter .
No .
Isn't that strange?
huh .
A long time ago or recently .
I wrote it over the Summer I wrote it in June or July .
hm I don't know .
mm .
With a picture did you send a picture?
No .
No just a letter .
let him know .
Because I was saying how we were coming in I wis
call let me write me and let me know when is a go
huh .
Bec- whenever I try to call I always get the machine .
yeah no I don't know .
Anyway .
Anyway I'm sorry go ahead .
no that's okay &um it could just be the post .
We have things lost we have other peoples' mail I me
yeah .
Right anyway &um .
xxx .
So .
eh it was kind of upsetting because I had hoped t
i- Dave was like we don't have the time and we don't
mhm .
and you know it turns out he just doesn't want to
mhm .
so he doesn't want to because he says i
So I said okay .
What am I going to do about this you know like wh
And I hate it for years I always just go in the b
mhm .
But I said okay I'll watch baseball with him .
So I sat there and you know what I realized .
Right .
I didn't really put it together over the Summer
oh .
Every other Summer we've been together every single
mhm .
And as soon as I sit down and do it with him he stops .
mm .
mhm .
Anyway so we didn't spend any time together and
oh .
And Dave just said well because we split up I need
mhm .
He said it's understandable that they should be angry with me .
because you took his son his son away from him .
What did I do I mean when I left with his son .
I don't I don't know .
Was with Dave's .
it was you know with his understanding .
mhm .
it was a supposedly an agreement we made together t
yeah .
So why are his parents punishing me .
hm .
They were really .
dreadful and then and very very cold .
And you know I have just been so devoted and so lo
yeah .
as my only vacation we spent all of our money .
xxx .
to go do that .
you know .
And they treat you like shit .
And they treated me like shit and it was very upsetting .
thanks a_lot .
<and I don't believe> [?] .
And Dave didn't stand up for me.
xxx .
You know what I mean.
mhm .
And then afterwards everyone was very upset and he .
didn't .
you know say oh they were wrong to treat you that way .
You know nothing like that .
What was his reasoning .
Right well what is it .
I mean he he says well they're mad at you and you kn
you know because he's English so he doesn't spell it all out .
you know .
yeah .
But he says it and leaves it open for me to infer
mm .
And then he doesn't contradict it .
You know and I say do you agree with them
yeah yeah .
And then &um .
So they're coming for three weeks I'm supposed to sp
My Christmas vacation in Texas with them .
mhm .
They're coming for three weeks the only time that we
mhm .
and meanwhile it's like he just ignores me .
when we're around them and I end up .
three of the days we were there he and his brother
clean the house and do the cooking and watch Sam .
I know .
mm .
You know it's incredible .
And this is my only vacation .
yeah .
So I'm supposed to spend my Christmas vacation wh
yeah .
with them and I said I can't do it .
and &um .
I told him that I really wanted him to .
come .
up for Christmas .
mhm .
So we can all be together for Christmas and I just
I mean I really struggled with it I really tried
every time I thought about it I'd just burst into tears .
yeah .
You know I love Christmas and thing is that I loved
mhm .
I really loved them and the fact that they could
they obviously never approved of me .
or why would they be treating me like this .
No no I I think .
They should be so happy that we're back together right?
yeah but probably they maybe at the time they took t
Right.
Parents always take a boy's side they always take the you know .
I know I know but it's just really hurt that they
I'm sure .
xxx .
you know maybe this was nobody's fault maybe it
Absolutely .
Instead of .
Did you try talking to them .
punishing me .
No because I didn't really realize what was going
yeah .
And because they're so indirect .
mhm .
They have this weird English oh no we're nice and polite .
yeah yeah yeah but meanwhile cold like ice .
yeah .
exactly .
yeah .
exactly .
So it was very hard to put it together and Dav
um disapproving of Sam but Dave was the one who to
I mean most the stuff I'm getting about them I'm get
oh .
So I don't even know like what is he just trying
yeah .
but I think that it's true I mean at some time he
You know .
m- mhm .
Like he doesn't have to tell me all these things I
mhm .
You know and and what did I do I mean I was the one
bent over backwards to make the relationship work I've done .
everything he said I was doing wrong that was k
Well .
nah it doesn't work that way .
hm I know it doesn't but you know it's like uch@s:he
But anyway so that's been the most recent .
So what how do you feel about them is it okay now it's okay .

You know I've devoted myself to him.
and &um .
I don't know I just I had so much invested in this .
you know .

mhm mhm .
I've got the appointment the .
right that's the day that Miriam comes .
I still feel kind of funny you know go- you know
yeah you do .
I should .

you know it seems like xxx that you know I should .
you know finish the check thing out .
right right .
have they checked just like inner ear stuff .
No they actually haven't I've got to talk to the

yeah .
yeah .
yeah there was this &um .
I mean I don't think I mean your symptoms probably

You can get this incredible disease I mean the whol
um no it was a bacterial thing that happened after

oh I think I heard something ab-.

serious I'm still waiting and seeing you know +/.
yeah yeah .
+, how things go .
I guess the hard thing is that how will you know wh
yeah yeah .

yeah well I mean I think I I assume it's going to b
more so even in a little while because &uh .
this one guy xxx who was like a a fresh br- breez
twenty four twenty five year old guy .
oh yeah you mentioned him .
yeah well he starts studies in the Technion on Tuesday .
mm mm .
that's it he's done .
hm .
And eh I'm sure if there was xxx .
he maybe maybe Miriam should meet him .
he has a serious girlfriend has
uh oh okay [=! laughing] .
yeah .
huh .
um .
but &uh I'm thinking it was definitely going to be
yeah yeah right .
hm .
oh tell me what are what are the &um leads that &uh
well she had her final thing and they found it en
mhm .
um but I'm not sure .
you know what they were called one may be ca- Ray-u
I heard of Ray-ut yeah .
that was one of them I don't know the other one &
n- not sort of Jewish .
uh and Arab but just Arab .
because I remember them saying something in a lette
xxx .
and but it was in the Galilee I mean saying what a good thing .
it could be .
for a Jewish person to be .
you know in a circumstance like this .
so that they would realize that Jews actually y
mm .
uhhuh .
+, in in and I think that was something involving k
mhm .
mhm .
um and then the other one I think and I don't know i
um .
a daycare center which is for both .
um it sounded actually very like it would b
a daycare center for Jewish and Arab kids and it was outside of .
either .
Haifa or Tel_Aviv I don't remember which one &
mhm .
there were kids from .
really troubled homes and it's like .
iffy .
it was very intensive daycare .
to avoid them being put in foster care .
oh wow .
so you have eh and but the second goal of the .
thing is to increase .
sort of coexistence +/.
mhm .
+, you know among these groups .
and Miriam is more interested in the second goal
she could be interested in but I think emotionally
yeah .
+, you know your sort of average cute cheery +/.
yes .
+, you know three year old .
right .
um you know they may be abused they may be you know
yeah .
um but I think there are other possibilities too and I think .
xxx .
um you know what they said basically to her and th
xxx .
they sounded really positive and like they were
any permanent assignments until the .
person meets with the people from that group .
wait th- I mean wh- where so when she comes arrive
Well she's going to at some point I mean she'l

mhm mhm .
xxx not as convenient but you know .
yeah well I mean I think she'd like to arrange
oh yeah .
yeah .
exactly yeah .
but &um but then I think she wants to get .
working on it and and some of them talk t
that some of these things .
provide housing in an absorption center some provide .
housing in a village which I told her to be real ca
I mean I think it would make it very hard for her t
mm .
yeah that's true too .
I mean you know like after eight o'clock she coul
well she's got to check not all villages are like that .
well that's true that's true .
I mean I know the I know the one that
some of them xxx .
yeah .
I mean his village apparently was quite traditional .
mhm .
um xxx but maybe you know .
I wonder if she'll be allowed to visit
Well you know he would not visit her the last time
I remember that .
If he's married now maybe he can I don't know .
I yeah .
or maybe with his wife he could .
Look it xxx one thing is for sure is like if she'
is that .

ah donei@s:jpn .
hai@s:jpn .
um .
I +/.
ouch .
+, wanted to have Pat and Renee and John and Dad over.
Pat Rene
hai@s:jpn .
Except +/.
mhm.
+, Pat has already planned all of that at her house.
oh.
With John and .
Renee and .
Dad at her place.
uhhuh.
So I asked Pat if she would .
consider having it all here instead.
You know coming here instead.
Everybody .
mhm.
And she says no.
uh.
She wants to have it at her place.
Well why did you want it .
at your place?
To show everybody your place?
well I'd like t
I mean I'd just li- would like to have Thanksgiving
We are invited to her place .
okay.
I me
We can do that.
mhm.
I told her I would check with you and and let her know.
mhm.
And you know and this was .
after I asked her and then she came back and said .
well I was planning on asking you.
I mean this and I had .
I'd I had to call her like five days later and fin
And she says well I want to have it at my house, but
mhm.
So you know, that's fine So we ca
+, do something else.

I mean what what do you think .
Well .
m-.
you know I w- I would like to be with Pat and Ren
mhm.
I mean that's my first preference.
mm .
I could have .
I could try to get Tony and .
and his girlfriend and .
Randy and his girlfriend over.
mhm.
Because I don't know what they'll be doing fo
You know it's not like they have another place to go.
mhm.
So .
You know the tradition has been Pat .
do her family and Dad and Jan does her family and .
of course Joan is gone .
so that kind of leaves the guys out.
ah right.
yeah I guess .
Tony and Randy what did they always do for Thanksgiving.
I don't even know.
mm .
You know.
Guess they wing it .
<yeah I guess they're> [?] .
So I mean that would be something.
yeah.
or we could tie in with Millers.
Which would not be my first choice.
xxx .
And Bobby is going to try and get down here.
okay.
Well isn't when is he finished?
Well he eh he's finished when .
he finds somebody else and when he has another job.

oh.
So there's no definite date.
Has he told them that?
yeah.
okay.
yeah, he won't just leave them.
yeah.
I thought maybe .
like a one month notice or something.
yeah, so I don't know he's waiting,
xxx .
+, coming up that &um .
it's a restaurant that's just being built and opened.
In Madison area.

yeah in Madison.
But it might be a good opportunity for him to lear
We're going to be coming up to our time here pretty soon.
Don't they give us a warning?
mhm.
They give us a one minute warning.
okay.
So do you have anything . 
um . 
and they're going to be here .
well .
if I come out to visit you that xxx will make it ea
xxx .
+, .
see them at the same time.
When are they going to be?
um, well, she goes to Wilston Northampton.
xxx .
uhhuh.
And they she said .

I just spoke to her a few minutes actually .
sh- I suppose I was talking to her when you tried t
um .
been a busy night.
m-.
xxx .
um .
I think she said sh-.
they're coming maybe on the twenty ninth.
So and I told them if they needed any help .
okay .
um .
you know .
I I kind of I can't make any plans for the twent
mhm.

But .
but basically, I mean .

drive them +/.
To western Mass.
+, out to western Mass and .
visit you on our way to New Hampshire.
Well .
Right.

I want you for more than a c
So .
yeah.
No, no.
I'm talking about more than a couple of hours.
um .
Cory and Paula .
will also be with us for Christmas .
Wow.
But .
really .
anywhere almost anywhere in that whole time
Y'all could come out.
okay.
So .
yeah.
Is there any time that's better than any other?
Well Christmas day probably wouldn't be the best.
yeah.
But it wouldn't be that bad.
yeah.
um, just try to think I .
e- Cory usually the way they have us sleeping is Co
and Paula in the back room.
But we have put Paula in .
the living room.
So actually there would be room for .
all of us to be there.
yeah but she shouldn't be kicked out for .
No, I mean, Paula sometimes sleeps in t
I think it may be a more comfortable mattress.
I mean +/. 
ah. 1
+, it wouldn't be k
That's Paula's normal place to sleep when she's . 1
so . 1
okay. 1
Well . 1
um . 1
e- my . 1
So it n- it really doesn't matter, I guess. 1
okay. 1
My my schedule is definitely . 1
I don't want to subject yo
I mean <I don't, know> [=! laughing] . 1
. 1
. 1
But . 1

probably not the best . 1

I have to . 1

Or something like that. 1
That would be so lovely. 1
. 1

And we could just play. 1
Ye- we could just play. 1
And all three of us will need to do so . 1

yeah. 1
You're right. 1
. 1
I'm so glad I'm going to get to see you

. 1
. 1
xxx . 1
So oh yeah like another thing, this is I don't know
. 1

Anyway . 1
You're getting married. 1

But I'm having major baby pangs. 1
. 1
Like . 1
Wait, is this what you were going to drop on me or . 1
Well I mean it's not, this is the thing that I'm
okay. 1
um . 1
but at some point when I'm somewhat mo
I mean for so long I was sure I didn't want
And now . 1
. 1
I rea
I think I want to have a baby. 1
And like be a mom. 1
oh [=! screaming] . 1
Great. 1

So . 1
and . 1
every time I say it . 1
Because one of my friends has to have a baby before I do. 1
Every time I s- oh I don't know if it'll be before you. 1
. 1
Every time I say it Heather says . 1
I'm not ready to think about that yet r-. 1
I told her I'm not xxx think abo
But you know this is just something I'm thinking ab
And the other night she said you know +/. 1
. 1
. 1
+, I think I might want to be a mom too. 1
. 1
So we may each be moms for no like +/. 1
Wow. 1
+, where we're going to find the dads. 1
. 1
But &um . 1
. 1
yeah. 1
. 1
mm. 1
That's a problem. 1
Could be. 1
yeah. 1
ouch. 1
. 1
But . 1
But . 1

I mean it would be interesting if my brother
eee. 1
For &um . 1
Heather. 1
yeah. 1
Because then it would be it would have some blood. 1
. 1
God. 1
And some McNealy blood. 1
But she doesn't have any acceptable male relatives. 1
. 1
. 1
. 1
. 1
. 1
so . 1
. 1
Wow. 1
Anyway. 1

S
And &um . 1
but that's not like . 1
you know news of the mome
That's just something I'm thinking about that I wan
And &um . 1
the other thing is I've been thinking about and
I was thinking about being an egg donor actually at a local +/. 1
Wow. 1
+, reproductive medicine clinic . 1
um . 1
largely because it paid fifteen hundred dol
. 1
But I went in for the preliminary exam . 1
um an interview . 1
did that just yesterday . 1
and &um . 1
. 1
Aside from it sounding kind of scary . 1
I mean I could probably do scary for fifteen
. 1
um . 1
. 1
it's like a two to three month process
So . 1
oh. 1
yeah. 1
So but I did find out that I have . 1
acceptably posi
And &um . 1
. 1
so you know maybe at some point in the future. 1
huh. 1
Kind o
The fifteen hundred dollars would have come in handy . 1
Well there's always San_Francisco. 1


I figure it's probably not exactly a novelty out there. 1
So . 1
that's something I may do at some point
Though e- on my way home on the bus I'm thinking . 1
I'm like sellin
They call it oocyte donation but they pay you
yeah. 1
So it's not really donation . 1
That's very interesting. 1
It is interesting. 1
<It's not some-> [?] . 1
It's a very interesting process really. 1
Really. 1
yeah. 1
I mean they explained like how they use the hormones to . 1
like turn off your ovaries and then . 1
overstimulate them and . 1
then how they ha
Which is not exactly a pleasant sounding experience . 1
. 1

I I kind of heard something about that. 1
. 1
. 1
mhm. 1
So. 1
I had a vaginal ultrasound which was really interesting. 1
So I like saw my ovaries on the little screen and . 1
Ugh. 1
oh it didn't hurt. 1
. 1
It was easier than a pelvic. 1
. 1
oh+god I have to go in and have one of those. 1
. 1
I haven't had one in o
I usually have them every August. 1
Sorry . 1
yeah, I have them in the spring. 1
. 1

No it's okay . 1
See part of what's . 1
see I have this . 1

e-. 1
e- that I I just . 1
actually I don't know . 1

m-. 1
I'm also having, from the time Becker comes . 1
well Becker comes for one weekend in November. 1

The thing is that the the papers are cumulative in a
so I can't start on the twenty page paper until afte
oh. 1
Right. 1
Right. 1

Beyond that the day after that paper is . 1

up in the attic crawl space very hard to get to .
Do you mean like maybe just even reverberations
Probably that what he thinks he just you know he j
mhm .
Anyhow as it was there there was no fire hazard
took him fore- you know he did not find it then a
Wow wow .
But anyway you replace that and a couple other circuits on it .

m-.
I'm sorry I was going to practice my Hebrew I can't

Having a olive s- olive picking olive s- some sort k
and a couple of small Jewish villages .

places where they make the olive oil and it sounds l
yeah that'll be nice I .
and we had ordered a car a while back we thought w
mhm .
but then it fell through because Abe and Dorothy
How's is u- Abe doing a letter better or .

Though Miriam did se- was there saw them for a coupl
and she said you can see it's not always the same because .
sometim- xxx she was talking to him .
and he was going over a map and pointing things out to her .
Which to her seemed like they were totally off .
and a little while later he was talking and all t
mhm .
He just speech is a little bit slurred but you ca
Which is better feeling it's probably how it's go
yeah .
I'm sure he's never going to drive again or anything

uhhuh.
So .
uh I've been trying to &um .
act a little better and I so I I have been acting a
No .
uhhuh [?] .
It's amazing how resentful I am of her when she
But eh she doesn't really ask for much she
And I could certainly be a_lot nicer and still not .
break my .
back at over anything .
mhm.
So &um that's been improving, my p- my at
And then .
this thing with .
you know with Jerry he's &um .
it's just it's it's it's .

I mean it's r- it
W- .
we ca
I'm not looking for anybody else and I'm not looking .
to get him out of my life and .
I'd still like to see him but .
I'd I don't ever want to live with him again, and
involved in his .
this .
finan- this insanity, this, you know he's just .

So .
all at once .
in the last day or two .
I've .
jus- I've just sort of realized I'm ready for
hm .
And I thought oh

been in a market for it.
up until now.
um .
and I I wouldn't know .
how to go about get
It's just that hey I think I'm ready for it, j- jus-.
oh .
m-.
Interesting .
yeah that sort of hit me too when I .
I told you about .
realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable an
It's okay but .
that's why I think I I'm going to go back to school .

a profession that I can use .
you know and get a job .

He says basically he says eh there's a whole outfit
But he got a .
an undergraduate degree in finance.

I don't know if I want to go that far .
but .
I'm just pointing in the direction of learning mo
And I've got a net worth statement now and it's .
I'm surp- <I'm just is> [?] .
I'm just surprised to learn that my net worth is i
like there's eight hundred and ten dollars every month .

and .

and of the three sisters one is another American .
and then the other two are native &uh Taiwanese people .
oh alright .

My other two companions speak much better Chines
the other is just a gifted person and .
you know just picks up real well so you know like s-.
And how long has she been here .
tha- the one that's gifted .
p- &um .
I mean picks up well .
she re- she .
she started when I did and last March .
she had studied for two months .
oh .
in the states .
and then this summer sh-.
before .
oh .
uh &uh she went back and studied again a
speaking and vocabulary so she's done extremely well .
wow my .
but she's she's also about thirty five years old .
oh but you know .
a- and a teacher .
oh okay but there is something about &um .
you know you have it or you don't .
you know .
I think that's true .
th- th- it's a gift because &um my niece Suzy .
you know she had learned German in &uh high school .
mhm .
and then she got a scholarship to Germany .
so her first year of college was in Germany .
mhm .
and then when she came back .

mhm .
Holland .

and within &um .

then she took Dutch .
you know .
mhm my gosh .
and speaks that very fluently .
and I thought well gee I didn't get that .
you know so she knows German and and Dutch ah .
a- and it just flows she just flows .

between German and Dutch you know I think if you learn German .
I I just have a feeling you can probably pick up Dutch .
with I had asked her about that but there's &uh .
uh .
No?
ye- to some extent but then you have to know which is which .
oh I see .
I- you know maybe maybe lamp &uh lamp in one and la

It had to be because it would come through the snow
mm . 1
