*B:	Right. 876630_876970

*B:	yeah. 891380_891650
*A:	Because she doesn't think the quality of her work has changed.

	as having attention deficit disorder.
*A:	Which . 972460_979470
*A:	you know, given how he's how far he's gotten, you know, he got his
	degree at Tufts and all, I found that surprising that for the first
	time as an adult they're diagnosing this.
*A:	um . 980180_989560
*B:	mm.
*B:	I wonder about it.
*B:	but anyway. 989420_991860

*B:	um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Guss. 155500_158710

*A:	And, &uh . 163100_169250
*B:	Well i-, well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to

*A:	oh. 175710_176000
*B:	So things are going extremely well.

	about uh, a day a week for the next two three years. 176520_188560
*A:	mhm. 188940_189300
*B:	Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it
	would make sense to do this.
*B:	And, &um . 188941_193930
*B:	and, um, I've been getting substantially more work than then. 194560_197690

*B:	So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon? 222540_225420
*A:	um.
*A:	I don't see the finances occurring . 226010_229290
*B:	uhhuh, right. 229480_230100
*A:	for a while. 229600_230250

*B:	But &um . 238070_238670
*A:	uh, uh, the the the main reason for that is I had not really
	anticipated a few expenses that recently came up . 239130_246640
*B:	ah. 246990_247620
*A:	uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had. 247010_250770

*A:	But &um . 262980_263610
*A:	Anyway, &uh . 265050_266030
*A:	One of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh,

*A:	I've actually been doing a_lot_of it. 273320_275390
*B:	oh wow. 276020_276620

*A:	yeah, actually it turns out that one thing, one little . 289920_293590
*A:	bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very
	important in the end. 294700_299340
*A:	And, uh, . 300090_300870
*A:	from what I had been reading in the literature.

*B:	yeah. 309270_309620

*A:	if you look at the total intensity . 359220_361240
*B:	uhhuh. 361830_362200
*A:	of the laser, you get . 361980_363520

*B:	mhm. 374140_374560
*A:	and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency. 374141_378360
*B:	okay. 379280_379680
*A:	So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase
	so that they completely mask each other's . 379400_386220
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	hm. 386300_387390
*A:	oscillations on these other frequencies.
*A:	And . 386910_390060
*A:	uh . 390920_391300
*A:	you can . 392300_392800
*A:	With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency . 393450_398130
*A:	in a transient, but you can't find that frequency in a driven, uh,
	frequency . 398920_404480
*A:	You can't find so that it will sustain. 405070_406910
*B:	okay.
*B:	Yes. 407430_408240
*A:	So . 408270_408770
*A:	yeah, that that particular frequency according to most models . 409240_412720
*A:	damps out very quickly.
*A:	And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it. 413160_417580
*B:	hm. 418320_418650
*A:	The only thing is, that, when you do the experiment you see it. 418740_422080
*B:	Got it, got it.
*B:	I see. 423040_424110
*A:	So, um, I found a . 424200_426620
*A:	simple modification of the original formula, which unfortunately
	makes the solutions horrendously nasty. 426970_433790
*A:	And in most cases, uh, insoluble. 434500_438390
*A:	But . 438960_439360
*B:	yeah. 438990_439260
*A:	it gives a driving term &=laughs . 440280_442480
*B:	oh, okay. 442940_443670
*A:	So, it actually &=laughs . 443180_444780
*A:	creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer, . 445490_448830
*A:	you just can't always write it down very easily. 449060_451500
*B:	Exactly. 451960_452590
*B:	oh wow.
*B:	So, so, so you, you-, you're pushing forward the bounds of
	theoretical laser . 453490_457890
*B:	laser, uh, whatever it is science. 458590_460580
*A:	But which, um, is kind of interesting considering that that's not
	really my thing. 460870_465860
*B:	&=laugh.
*B:	Indeed &=laughs.
*B:	Indeed. 466180_468870
*A:	Be- being an experimentalist, not a theorist.
*A:	But &um . 468580_471800
*B:	Indeed.
*B:	oh wow.
*B:	oh, impressive. 471780_473680
*A:	But . 474050_474240
*B:	So, so, so are, so are you going to get an article in Nature or
	something? 474180_477020
*A:	um, actually, . 477570_479430
*A:	I'm not sure if we're shooting for op-, I think . 480570_484800
*A:	Optics Letters is probably the one that we're shooting for, or
	else, perhaps, though . 485570_493200
*A:	I don't think it's quite that significant, would be Phys Rev
	Letters. 494450_497960
*B:	hm. 498610_498880
*A:	But, uh, we want to write a letter, and then a couple articles. 499490_504170
*B:	yeah.
*B:	hm.
*B:	xxx &=distorted impressive. 504730_506820
*A:	And . 506090_506780
*A:	I, I don't know how much you know about scientific literature, but
	letters are much more prestigious than, articles. 507780_513590
*B:	oh, okay.
*B:	oh, w-, I I didn't realize that.
*B:	okay. 514680_517110
*A:	yeah, so that that's why it's actually a big deal is . 516729_519860
*A:	I mean, you know, writing a couple of articles based on your
	Master's thesis, is, . 520190_523870
*A:	not at all unusual in Physics &=inhales and . 524210_528090
*B:	yeah. 527490_527740
*A:	uh, i- it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the
	impressive part of it all. 528440_534250
*A:	And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that
	I thought that this was kind of significant. 534720_540150
*A:	And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the
	thesis down that . 540990_547120
*B:	&=laughs . 547550_548120
*A:	people have been seeing th-.
*A:	You know, people see the anti phased motion, and it's true they do
	in the transients And . 547790_554740
*A:	I was having a_lot_of trouble getting across to him that all of the
	literature is in . 554810_558430
*A:	has this frequency in the transients . 559130_561560
*B:	Yes. 562230_562500
*A:	eh and not driven.
*A:	And, uh, what happened was after I had turned in my thesis . 562230_569480
*A:	but before I saw Neil again, he went to a conference in Rochester
	and &=inhales there . 570130_575810
*A:	this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work,
	was, . 576290_579540
*A:	that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency, yet
	their experiments showed it . 580270_585610
*B:	&=laughs . 585880_587850
*A:	as a driven frequency. 585880_587220
*B:	oh cool. 587910_588520
*A:	And s- and so Neil . 587911_589290
*A:	then +/. 589920_590270
*B:	Said oh just a second I . 590310_591710
*A:	+, like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said, hey Lowell, we
	got to write this up &=laughs . 590630_595430
*B:	Exactly &=laugh. 595960_596880
*A:	And I was like, well I've been telling you that Neil &=laughs . 596540_598440
*B:	Indeed. 598840_599340
*A:	So . 600180_600530
*B:	Cool. 601580_601930
*A:	That's . 601910_602330
*B:	Cool. 602250_602580
*A:	that's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a_lot_of time on
	now.
*A:	um . 602940_607450
*B:	Well it'll look good on your C V, your resume.
*B:	So &=breath so you might as well spend the time. 607430_611960
*A:	Yes, well, &=inhales uh, th- no, it's definitely worth doing.
*A:	um, . 613570_617730
*A:	and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for uh
	dealing with the burglary issues &=echo . 618260_623690
*B:	oh yeah but . 623480_624710
*A:	that I've been dealing with. 624010_625090
*B:	So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park. 625210_627550
*A:	Yes. 627680_628140
*B:	&=lipsmack yeah, okay.
*B:	yeah. 628600_629600
*A:	I mean the thing that i- this place is incredibly easy to break
	into if you want to. 630190_635220
*B:	oh. 630520_630840
*A:	It's not a question of whether or not, &uh . 636000_639070
*A:	you know, that, that was easy, it was just that no one really knew
	it was worth breaking into. 640070_645090
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	yeah. 645340_646870
*A:	And so the problem is that now they found out that it's worth
	breaking into. 646660_650420
*B:	yeah. 651170_651420
*A:	And unfortunate^ly .
*A:	Well, i- it's kind of odd.
*A:	They've stolen very weird things for the most part. 651440_658480
*B:	hm. 659150_659400
*A:	A- as far yeah as a.
*A:	The first time they broke in, they . 659340_663710
*A:	what they stole was just bizarre, mostly worthless . 664170_668270
*A:	stuff. 668910_669440
*A:	And, &uh . 670690_672070
*B:	huh . 671840_672090
*A:	the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they
	stole was the preamplifier of my stereo. 672450_680570
*A:	Unfortunately, because it's a nice preamplifier, it has an off
	board power supply which they didn't steal, . 681240_687810
*B:	&=breath . 688310_688930
*A:	which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless. 688810_691880
*B:	huh &=laughing:breath. 692990_693720
*A:	So. 695850_696310
*B:	That's &=distortion bizarre.
*B:	Bizarre. 696370_697750
*B:	So, so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh,
	the &uh off board amplifier? 698650_702350
*A:	Actually, no, all they stole the second time was my bike. 702640_706090
*B:	huh. 707010_707350
*A:	Which was actually where the major problem came. 707350_710610
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	yeah. 710880_712420
*A:	Is that I suddenly had no transportation.
*A:	And so, . 711440_715290
*A:	I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike, and
	. 716140_719930
*B:	mm. 720470_720890
*A:	that that cost me a_lot_of time. 720471_722660
*B:	yeah.
*B:	Exactly. 723100_724060
*A:	Because, yes . 723101_724000
*A:	Spending a_lot_of time hunting for bikes, and . 724820_727140
*B:	nah well. 727970_728660
*A:	then getting one purchased, and then having to, . 728260_730680
*A:	you know, go get it and things like that.
*A:	But, . 731230_733450
*A:	that's dealt with at least.
*A:	And so . 734320_736030
*A:	uh, that's &=breath yeah . 737520_739590
*A:	at least dealt with.
*A:	Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this.
*A:	But . 740030_744960
*B:	yeah. 745240_745610
*A:	yeah.
*A:	At least . 745630_747100
*B:	Well that would make sense &=distortion . 746550_747720
*A:	during the summer I can actually, . 747660_750270
*A:	uh . 751130_751570
*A:	according to the stipulations of my grant, or my fellowship, I can
	actually earn money during the summer. 752280_758880

*A:	I know Sue is going to r- Rhode Island. 121090_122950
*B:	eh Right Right. 122130_123240
*A:	Did she see her mom? 123220_124330
*B:	Yes she did. 124520_125350

*B:	Yes she did. 127150_127880
*A:	And? 127920_128740
*B:	um, which was um, which we had already anticipated that it was
	going to happen. 129050_134360
*B:	I spoke to her: mom on Thursday and &um . 134730_138790
*B:	and I asked her I said listen &=laughs I said &um please come to

*B:	uh parenting.
*B:	uh would you mind &uh taking her back and she said no.
*B:	She said &uh she'd be more than happy to. 148860_156340
*A:	Really?
*A:	This girl is like has everything in her dreams you know
	&=distorted. 157930_162700

	has just painted the road and all I had to do was get on it and
	follow it. 166000_176490
*B:	I-, I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck

	194900_198180
*A:	Really? 199100_200130
*B:	mhm mhm. 199790_200940
*A:	And, and, and is she seem like she's together enough? 201050_203600
*B:	She's in a, she's in a two year program.
*B:	She's in the program now.
*B:	She's doing very well.
*B:	When I talked to her it's a, I, I'm talking to her like I'm talking
	to you. 202800_211680
*B:	I wrote her a letter and told her I said I think I said I I feel
	like I know you even though I never met you. 212060_216550
*A:	They seemed surprised that, I mean most women you lose your baby
	that's it. 217450_220750

*B:	That's true.
*B:	That's true.
*B:	But that's what she had wrote me.
*B:	She said, she said, she said it, it is just awesome to her what is,
	what is happening. 222260_229820
*B:	yup.
*B:	mhm. 230240_231270
*A:	aw I've heard of that. 231140_232350
*B:	yup.
*B:	So Francis . 232370_233460
*A:	Did she say how she felt about what had happened? 232900_235780
*B:	No.
*B:	We, we haven't really talked about that but I'm planning on making
	a trip down to visit her. 236660_241150
*A:	Well, what how does Akina feel? 241110_242430
*B:	She, she's, u-, u-, very happy about it.
*B:	Very ha-. 242950_246380
*A:	Well did she come home and say I saw her, I look like her or what?
	245890_249490
*B:	We, we talked on the phone and you know she talked about &um her
	sisters and you know and things we've spent the night with her
	sisters . 248840_256280
*B:	and things and &um it's just been quite interesting although when
	she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive, &um down there and
	really caused Francis a_lot_of stress . 256870_268050
*B:	and &um Francis was very worried about me because she came home two
	weeks before you know f- &um because she just was acting like a
	total nigger child. 268590_276880
*B:	uhoh! 277260_277700
*B:	Hope the research didn't hear that!

*A:	&=laughs wait wait Alita I'm telling you nobody can handle her but
	you, okay &=laughs . 281320_286100
*B:	And um, but um, . 285520_287040
*B:	but she, she was very concerned about me and everything and um
	because &um the child had told some, some lies about me and about
	you. 287440_296550
*A:	oh. 293920_294130
*A:	oh . 295470_296340
*A:	oh no &=distorted . 296720_297910

*A:	oh goodness. 299480_300650
*B:	yeah.
*B:	That we were abusing, that &um you know, oh yeah she, she did some
	eh, and it was, it was very, very bad.
*B:	My daughter in+law Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday.
	300200_310750
*B:	Told her that she couldn't talk to Jasmine play with Jasmine
	because she hurt hur- because she said she hurt Jasmine's Jetta . 311390_318000

	you know Jasmine's daddy wouldn't be oh she'd oh man &uh it was . 318400_328260
*A:	aw xxx.
*A:	You know that has always been very scary to me even after xxx.
*A:	I said to Mark oh+my+god &=laughs What's she going to say because I
	knew what she would do when if I took her somewhere . 327530_338180
*A:	you know what she would say and I, you know in these, the climate
	of today, . 338940_343790
*B:	Yes. 343650_344170
*A:	people saying something like that. 344250_345950
*B:	That well, you know that's and Francis was very concerned in
	reference to you know she was in school and things and Francis was,
	w-, she was very, very concerned.
*B:	She said Alita she said this little girl has a serious problem.
*B:	She wrote me a letter . 345400_358710
*A:	mhm &=distorted. 359340_359910

	to be doing that but I, but I think he's at a point now where he's
	reserved us . 383500_390910

*A:	Does it wake you up? 391170_392080
*B:	No he hasn't woken me up yet, but if I wake up in the middle of the

*A:	huh. 412380_412570
*B:	But it might be a girl.
*B:	I was positive it was a girl. 412970_415970
*B:	Like the first three months, I was absolutely positive it was a

*A:	&=laughs . 440480_440930
*B:	If, if you want to know, just send me email.
*B:	Because I looked up a bunch of stuff, but, there's all this

*B:	It's not just amnio, it's like &=inhales other stuff too. 449660_452870
*A:	uhhuh. 452720_453250
*B:	And then there's also, um, . 453340_455000
*B:	you know, the, the, uh, the ultrasound.
*B:	But &=exhale in fact, like . 455870_459830
*B:	if you look at the l, the la-, the latest research on ultrasound,
	it's like, they really don't know. 460240_465200
*B:	&=inhales Like they assume that it's safe, because, you know,
	they've had it for twenty years, right. 465460_469910
*A:	And nothing has happened? 470220_471120
*B:	They never . 470400_470830
*B:	Ye-, well they don't know.
*B:	They've never really done any big studies on it or anything. 471530_475370
*B:	But the but if you're a normal, low, like there's reasons to have
	an ultrasound.
*B:	And if you have to have an ultrasound, then it's a really good
	diagnostic tool, right? 475930_484230
*A:	Right. 484150_484440
*B:	But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it's not a good
	diagnostic tool at all.
*B:	Like, . 484990_490790
*B:	is they find as many, um, false positives as they do false
	negatives. 491710_495850
*A:	For, for spina_bifida and stuff? 496090_498150
*B:	Well the only thing they can really check, they can check the
	heart. 498440_501080
*A:	uhhuh. 501470_501880
*B:	&=inhales And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain.
*B:	&=inhales And then they can do like . 501890_506320
*B:	yeah.
*B:	But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has, um,
	. 507340_511060
*B:	ah . 512570_513099
*A:	Defects of various kinds. 512700_513930
*B:	Like Down's Syndrome.
*B:	Like sometimes y- But that's not really very good.
*B:	Like amnio is the only sure way to find out. 514210_520919
*A:	Right. 521030_521300
*B:	But it could give you like some indications that the baby might
	have Down's or something. 521250_524800
*B:	But it's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people
	with low risk pregnancies.
*B:	So, . 525420_529700
*A:	yeah. 530030_530280
*B:	&=inhales I didn't bother getting one. 530031_531260
*A:	yeah, good.
*A:	I'm sure everything will be fine &=laugh. 532140_534510
*B:	oh yeah. 534560_535270
*A:	And if it's not, it's like, you know, you're going to have to deal
	with it anyway. 535400_538670
*B:	Well what are you going to do I mean, if it's not, like &=inhale
	and we didn't do any of the testing because, like, . 537260_542010
*B:	I, I've met like three people since I got pregnant, where the baby
	had Down's, right.
*B:	They found out the baby had Down's. 542850_549250
*B:	And they aborted it.
*B:	They had, well, it's not called abortion, it's called termina-. 550120_553950
*A:	Termination, that's right. 553750_555330
*B:	And I jus-, I just couldn't have done that.
*B:	I just.
*B:	We talked about it a little bit, you know what I mean.
*B:	Like . 555390_560500
*B:	obviously I don't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything
	like that.
*B:	But . 560920_564810
*A:	But if it does, you'll deal with it. 564950_566570
*B:	I just could not have done that.
*B:	So it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing.
*B:	Because, you know . 566080_571410
*A:	If you're not going to abort anyway, then there's no reason to have
	it. 572280_575190
*B:	yeah. 574310_574730
*B:	I mean there are like some, there are some conditions that they can
	test for that are sort of incompatible with life. 575660_581150
*A:	Right. 581750_582010
*B:	But then I figured, well, I'll just go through the nine months of
	pregnancy and then the baby will die when it's born.
*B:	You know. 581751_587720
*A:	If it's like that. 587730_588540
*B:	yeah. 588950_589200
*A:	yeah, we had this friend.

*B:	yeah.

*B:	Then he just ends up making nobody happy. 218870_220760

*B:	Wow. 257630_258070
*A:	Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said

*A:	a, a very narrow district and it created a majority black district

*A:	a, a black representative and then it was challenged because it

*A:	I mean it's, it . 321320_322210
*B:	So it's interesting because today we had a discussion with students

*B:	just like different topics that they might encounter in America

*B:	So that was one of the things kind of like that &=distortion . 342520_344240
*B:	But I have I'm not really up on what the attitude is in America
	because I haven't been there in so long &=laughs . 345270_349140
*A:	Well there's a_lot_of frustration I think over the fact that

	. 349620_355860
*A:	program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people
	are saying wait a minute.

	feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race
	&=breath . 363620_369630
*A:	go at it from the standpoint of, of trying to remedy it through the
	courts &=breath . 369800_374000
*A:	rather than saying that government has to give X number of
	contracts to minority no matter what. 374060_379800
*B:	Right. 380760_381110
*A:	And as a result some &uh m- some people are getting contracts just

*A:	of the color of their skin and you know what I'm saying it's, it's,
	it's still . 387110_390690

*A:	e- either them they're, they're not even, they're not the low bid .
	392310_395260

*B:	Right. 401050_401510
*A:	And but now you've, there have been several cases where clearly you
	know it was, . 401550_405670
*A:	they didn't get it because &=laughs they just didn't weren't the

*A:	So now is that . 409790_410460
*B:	Right. 410190_410530
*A:	is that really remedying the situation or is it's creating a_lot_of

*B:	I just uh, . 404890_407650
*B:	you know, I mean there's a difference between guests and there's a
	difference between ownership, I think.
*B:	I think that . 408260_413450

*A:	yeah. 418680_419120
*B:	But if I'm staying somewhere, it doesn't mean I'm I'm I'm in jail.

*A:	yeah. 435400_435840
*B:	You know I told him, I said I have no time to do anything.
*B:	And I I said I . 435710_438240
*A:	Well maybe that's why he was trying . 438210_440500
*B:	And as soon as as soon as I move back here, he's out. 440340_442820
*B:	I I I'm I'm to- totally insist on it.
*B:	I don't care if he never talks to me again. 443550_447370
*B:	Because, there's no way I can study with worrying about keeping
	somebody awake, or, you know, I have to worry how w-, how I'm

*B:	You know.
*B:	Whatever. 447790_457140

*B:	so &uh . 877460_878290
*B:	It would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn't
	necessarily live there but I on the other hand it may not be great
	experie- the other one is Edison New Jersey but they . 878950_886540
*B:	what we don't like about that is that's a nicer area probably but
	uh and it's only a couple hours from here . 887330_892660
*B:	he'd have to relocate either way . 893400_894910
*B:	but &uh Edison &uh . 895190_897150
*B:	the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about a
	permanent position . 897990_901790
*B:	then he's saying well they're trying to get rid of one teacher they

*B:	if he gets the . 920040_921320
*B:	I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it . 921940_924240
*B:	because it is a regular . 924720_926290
*B:	fulltime job even though it might not be the great the great school
	. 926550_929560
*B:	but it depends what they come back with at Edison too so tomorrow
	he's suppos-. 930180_934140
